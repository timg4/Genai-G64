  "summary": "Over this 6\u2011hour window the turbine remained in **Normal Operation** for all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals, with relatively steady conditions (wind speed mean **5.89** with low variability, and correspondingly stable power output mean **0.183** with modest scatter). Rotational behavior was generally stable, with low rotor RPM variability (**0.50**) but higher generator RPM variability (**56.4**) consistent with normal operating modulation. Notable patterns include a **positive average yaw misalignment (~8.16)** and a **negative mean power residual (\u20110.0598)**, indicating output tended to run below the reference on average despite otherwise steady operation."
