  "summary": "Across the 6\u2011hour window the turbine remained in Normal Operation for all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals and produced very steady near\u2011rated power (power_mean\u22480.9755 with extremely low variability), consistent with the high\u2011wind tag. Wind speed was generally strong and fairly stable on average (mean\u224818.0, std\u22481.0) but included at least one brief spike to 33.9.\n\nNotable patterns/anomalies in the statistics include zero variability in rotor RPM (rotor_rpm_std=0.0) alongside some generator RPM variability (std\u22480.61), a persistent positive yaw misalignment on average (~8.15), and a consistently negative power residual (mean\u2248\u20110.107). Pitch and temperature were stable around 14.84 and 67.43, respectively."
