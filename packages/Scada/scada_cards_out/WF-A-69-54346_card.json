  "summary": "Over this 6\u2011hour window the turbine spent all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals in Normal Operation, with generally steady winds (mean 5.04 m/s, std 0.50) and low, relatively stable power output (mean 0.092, std 0.031). Operational indicators were mostly steady (small rotor RPM variability, modest yaw misalignment ~2.07\u00b0, pitch mean \u22121.11), but the window is characterized by a consistent negative power residual (mean \u22120.094) aligned with the \u201cpower_deficit\u201d tag. One notable anomaly in the summary stats is a very high reported wind speed maximum (28.1) relative to the otherwise tight wind distribution."
