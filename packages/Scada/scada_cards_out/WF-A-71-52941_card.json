  "summary": "Across the 6\u2011hour window the turbine remained in **Normal Operation** for all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals, with generally **low and steady wind** (mean 1.21 m/s, std 0.39; max 5.2). **Power output stayed near zero and stable** (mean \u22120.0015, std 0.0003) while **rotor RPM showed no variability** (std 0.0) despite some **generator RPM variability** (std 13.19). A notable operational pattern is the **high average yaw misalignment** (mean 76.6) alongside a **positive mean power residual** (0.1677)."
