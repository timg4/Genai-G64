  "summary": "Over this 6\u2011hour window the turbine remained in **Normal Operation** for all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals, with consistently **near\u2011zero and very stable power output** (power_mean \u22120.0024, low power_std 0.0009) alongside a relatively **high average pitch angle** (pitch_mean 24.0). Wind conditions were generally low on average (wind_speed_mean 1.64, std 0.57) but included an **isolated high wind-speed spike** (wind_speed_max 17.2) that does not coincide with a notable change in mean power behavior. A persistent operational pattern is **large yaw misalignment on average** (yaw_misalignment_mean 67.6; tagged), with moderate variability in rotor speed (rotor_rpm_std 0.64) and higher variability at the generator (generator_rpm_std 83.3), while temperatures were steady around 35.0\u00b0C and the power residual stayed positively biased (mean 0.1147)."
