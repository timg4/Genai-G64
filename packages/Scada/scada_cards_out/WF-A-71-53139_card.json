  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window the turbine stayed in **Normal Operation** throughout (37 ten\u2011minute intervals) with generally **steady production**: low average power (mean 0.1545) and moderate variability (power std 0.0794), consistent with modest winds (wind speed mean 5.42 m/s, std 1.10). Wind conditions were mostly stable but included an **isolated high wind-speed outlier** (max 21.3 m/s) relative to the mean.\n\nOperational indicators were largely stable (rotor RPM std 0.68, generator RPM std 76.55) with **average pitch near -1.2** and a **non-zero mean yaw misalignment** (~9.78). The **power residual was consistently negative on average** (mean -0.0842), indicating production tended to run below the reference expectation during this period, while temperatures were steady around **46.35**."
