  "summary": "Across the 6\u2011hour window the turbine spent all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals in Normal Operation with steady, near\u2011rated production (power_mean 0.969, low variability; rotor_rpm_std 0.023 and generator_rpm_std 2.33), alongside relatively high average winds (14.84 m/s) and typical pitch behavior (pitch_mean 9.14). Notable anomalies in the signals include a brief extreme wind speed maximum (39.2 m/s) compared with otherwise modest variability, sustained yaw misalignment on average (~10.22), elevated temperatures (temp_mean 65.16), and a consistently negative power residual (mean \u22120.0649) indicating production running below the reference model over the period."
