  "summary": "Over this 6\u2011hour window, the turbine spent all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals in a Downtime state, with power essentially flat and near rated (mean 0.9755, extremely low variability) despite steady mean winds (15.74 m/s). Operational signals show limited mechanical variation (rotor RPM std 0.0; generator RPM low std 0.31) with moderate pitch (mean 10.65\u00b0) and low yaw misalignment (mean 1.58\u00b0), while anomalies include a large wind-speed spike (max 36.8 m/s), persistent negative power residual (mean \u22120.1117; power_deficit tag), and elevated temperature levels (mean 67.03; elevated_temps tag) alongside high_wind conditions."
