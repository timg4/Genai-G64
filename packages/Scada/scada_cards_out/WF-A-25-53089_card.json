  "summary": "Over this 6\u2011hour window the turbine remained in Normal Operation for all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals, with fairly steady production (power mean 0.1338, std 0.0514) under moderate winds (wind speed mean 5.61 m/s, std 0.64). Rotor and generator speeds were generally stable (rotor rpm std 0.495; generator rpm std 55.87) with a consistent average pitch of about -1.44 and mean temperature around 48.18.\n\nNotable anomalies in the window-level stats include an extreme wind speed maximum of 36.9 relative to the mean, a persistent positive yaw misalignment average (~11.9), and a negative mean power residual (-0.0895), indicating production tended to be below the reference expectation on average."
