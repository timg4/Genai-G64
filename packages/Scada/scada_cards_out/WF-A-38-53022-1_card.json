  "summary": "Across the 6\u2011hour window the turbine was in Normal Operation for all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals, with generally steady production (power_mean\u22480.96, low power_std\u22480.028) under moderately variable winds (wind_speed_mean\u224814.6 m/s, std\u22481.74) but with at least one brief extreme wind spike (wind_speed_max=39.1). Operational signals show stable rotor behavior (low rotor_rpm_std\u22480.05) while generator speed varied more (generator_rpm_std\u22484.56), with average pitch around 8.9\u00b0 and a persistent mean yaw misalignment near 11.9\u00b0. Notable anomalies/patterns include a consistent negative power residual (mean\u2248\u22120.093) indicating a sustained power deficit relative to expectation, alongside elevated average temperature (~71.3) during this high\u2011wind period."
