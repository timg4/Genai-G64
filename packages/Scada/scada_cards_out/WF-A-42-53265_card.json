  "summary": "Across this 6\u2011hour window the turbine spent all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals in **Downtime**, with **near\u2011zero power** output (power_mean \u22120.0042, very low variability). Ambient conditions were generally **low wind** on average (2.68 m/s) with intermittent higher gusts (max 10 m/s), but there was no corresponding production response; pitch remained very high on average (~88\u00b0) and yaw misalignment averaged ~29\u00b0. Residual power was slightly positive (0.0038) while temperatures were stable around ~30\u00b0C, and rotor/generator speed variability was limited to modest fluctuations."
