  "summary": "Across the 6\u2011hour window the turbine remained in **Normal Operation** for all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals, with **very low and steady power output** (power_mean \u2248 \u20110.0025, power_std \u2248 0.0011) under generally **low wind conditions** (wind_speed_mean \u2248 1.48, std \u2248 0.72), despite a brief wind spike to 8.0. Operationally, pitch averaged **~23.7\u00b0**, while drivetrain speed variability was modest at the rotor and higher at the generator (rotor_rpm_std \u2248 1.93; generator_rpm_std \u2248 220.9). The notable anomaly is a **persistently large yaw misalignment** (mean \u2248 103.2; tagged) alongside a **positive mean power residual** (~0.081)."
