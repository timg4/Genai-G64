  "summary": "Over this 6\u2011hour window the turbine remained in Normal Operation for all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals, producing very steady power (mean ~0.975 with negligible variability) despite elevated and variable winds (mean ~18.0, max 33.9; tagged high_wind). Operationally, pitch averaged ~14.84 with modest yaw misalignment (~8.15), while rotor speed showed no variability and generator speed varied slightly. Anomalies/patterns to note are the consistently negative power residual (mean \u22120.107) and the combination of high wind variability with essentially flat power output."
