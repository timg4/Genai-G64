  "summary": "Across the 6-hour window (37\u00d710\u2011min intervals), the turbine remained in Normal Operation with generally steady production: mean power 0.9529 with low variability (std 0.0218) alongside relatively stable wind (mean 12.6514, std 0.644). A notable anomaly is the single high-wind extreme (wind_speed_max 30.2) occurring within an otherwise consistent wind regime, and the period is tagged for elevated temperatures (temp_mean 73.973) with a modest positive power residual on average (power_residual_mean 0.1249). Rotor speed appears unusually constant (rotor_rpm_std 0.0) while generator speed shows slight variation (generator_rpm_std 0.6399), with average pitch 3.5432 and small mean yaw misalignment (2.4838)."
