  "summary": "Across the 6\u2011hour window the turbine remained in **Normal Operation** for all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals, with **steady power output** (power_mean \u2248 0.975, very low power_std) under generally **high average winds** (wind_speed_mean \u2248 14.25 m/s, low std) but with an **isolated extreme wind spike** (wind_speed_max 43.7). Operationally, rotor speed appears **unchanging** (rotor_rpm_std = 0) while generator speed shows only **minor variation**, with **moderate pitch** (mean \u2248 9\u00b0) and **persistent yaw misalignment** (mean \u2248 9.54\u00b0). Notable anomalies include a **consistent negative power residual** (mean \u2248 \u22120.096) aligning with the **power_deficit** tag and **elevated temperatures** (temp_mean \u2248 66.7)."
