4. SCOPE 
Global Wind Organisation is a non-profit body founded by the wind turbine manufacturers and owners. Our 
members strive for an injury free work environment in the wind turbine industry, setting common 
international standards for safety training and emergency procedures. 
This standard describes the requirements for blade repair training that are recommended by the members of 
GWO. The standard comprises of one module. 
GWO recognises trained persons as competent within blade repair in the wind industry. GWO accepts the 
trained person as possessing the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to stop an unsafe work situation 
where they, as duty holders, are accountable for safety. 
This standard has been developed in response to the demand for recognisable blade repair training in the 
industry and has been prepared in co-operation between the members of GWO based on risk assessments, 
in-depth descriptions of job roles and tasks relevant to blade repair in the wind industry as well as factual 
incident and accident statistics from G+ and the wind industry. 
Training is verified through GWO’s WINDA database. 
General feedback on this document can be sent to info@globalwindsafety.org See globalwindsafety.org on 
how to raise a complaint about a training provider or report a safety incident occurring during training. 
5. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE GWO BLADE REPAIR 
Upon completion of the GWO Blade Repair Standard (BR), participants will be aware of the risks and hazards 
encountered when working with blade inspection and repair within the wind industry. Furthermore, they will 
be able to control and mitigate those risks and hazards. 
The GWO Blade Repair Standard training will also equip participants with the knowledge, skills, and 
confidence to appropriately respond in the event of a hazardous situation and to increase their safety 
through proper use of personal protective equipment, emergency equipment, procedur es and safe 
craftsmanship. 
5.1 Target Group 
Personnel who will be working in the wind industry, specifically in relation to composite inspection and repair 
work. Personnel that perform job functions (that have been risk assessed by their employer or their workplace 
duty holder) that are defined as functions where composite work training, according to this standard, may 
mitigate some of the identified hazards and risks. 
5.2 Aims and Objectives 
Training in accordance with this standard will enable participants to support and care for themselves and 
others working in the wind industry by possessing the knowledge and skills of composite inspection and 
repair work. Upon completion of the GWO Blade Repair Standard training course, participants will be able to 
work safely with composite materials while conducting inspection and basic blade repair procedures, thereby

Technical training 
supporting an overall improvement of the safety for personnel with job functions focussing on composite 
repair work and inspection in the wind industry. 
5.3 Validity Period 
The blade repair training is an enduring qualification and therefore a validity period does not apply to this 
training. This assumes that the participants are actively working with composite inspection and repair. 
5.4 Course Codes 
Module Course Code 
Blade Repair BR 
Table 5.4.1 – GWO Blade Repair module course code 
5.5 Participant Prerequisites for the Blade Repair Module 
All personnel participating in Blade Repair Module training shall be medically fit and capable of fully 
participating. Specifically, the participants must be made aware of the risks and hazards related to 
completing this course while being allergic to the materials used in the module. This also applies for 
participants suffering from asthma and hyperhidrosis manuum (excessive hand sweating). 
In addition to the above, all personnel participating must meet the participant prerequisites described in the 
GWO Requirements for Training. 
6. GENERAL RESOURCES REQUIRED TO DELIVER BLADE REPAIR

Technical training 
3. Act as first responder in the case of an accident 
Supporting staff: 
1. A person with a valid first aid qualification shall be present during all practical training. This can be 
the instructor or an assigned emergency response team 
6.2 Practical Training Facilities 
All facilities shall be maintained and, where appropriate, inspected and tested in accordance with current 
national legislation and manufacturers’ specification. It is recommended that the facilities reach European 
standards. 
Risk assessments shall be conducted and documented for all training facilities. The training provider shall 
hold the required permits to operate the facilities. 
The learning process is facilitated by comparable elements, comparing the training environment and the 
participants’ working environment. Comparable elements enhance the application of what is learned. The 
practical training facilities and the training environment are therefore expected to incorporate as many 
elements comparable to a real wind turbine working environment as is reasonably practicable. 
The practical training facility should enable each participant to, individually and/or as part of a team, see, 
hear and practise the taught subject matter in such a way that it resembles the working practices in a real 
wind turbine environment. 
The following training facility items will be required for the blade repair training: 
A workshop area with sufficient: 
1. dust extraction to ensure that the amount of dust in the air is kept below 10 milligrams per cubic 
metre 
2. filtration of extracted air to prevent environmental contamination 
3. exposure control measures to limit exposure limits for the instructor and participants to those as 
stated in the safety data sheet for all materials being used 
4. temperature and humidity control to ensure that all materials being used are used within the usage 
limits specified in the technical data sheet for those materials 
5. segregation from classrooms and administrative areas to prevent cross contamination of chemicals 
6. waste segregation to prevent cross contamination 
The training provider must ensure that chemical waste is disposed of in accordance with national legislation. 
The training provider must provide a changing area between workshop areas and clean areas like classrooms 
and administration areas where participants and staff can change their shoes to prevent contamination of 
clean areas with chemicals.

must be followed. 
6.3 Training Equipment 
The equipment required for training as listed in Annex 1 must be available and must fulfil national legal 
requirements in the country where the training is taking place. 
7. USING THIS STANDARD TO DEVELOP TRAINING 
The training in this standard is designed around the GWO taxonomy described in the GWO Requirements 
for Training. Theoretical and practical activities must be delivered according to the defined taxonomic level 
in order to reach the described learning objectives. 
When teaching equipment, a generic approach shall be applied aiming to avoid additional potential product 
specific formal training after completion of this training. However, national or regional legislation, company 
gap analysis and location specific risk assessments may require additional product specific familiarisation 
which is the responsibility of the duty holder. 
In addition to this, all training based on this standard including all related resources shall, as a minimum, 
meet the requirements described in the GWO Requirements for Training. 
8. ADMINISTRATION AND CERTIFICATION OF MODULE 
8.1 Participant Performance Assessment 
Participants will be assessed by means of direct observation and supplementary oral questions where 
appropriate (formative evaluation). The participants will also be subjected to written phase tests after theory 
elements, and again after the close of the training course (summative evaluation). 
The written tests can consist of multiple choice or descriptive answer questions and shall be set at the same 
taxonomy level as the objective that they are testing. There shall be at least one question for each lesson in 
the module. 
The written tests shall be conducted in accordance with the following criteria: 
1. there shall be an instructor present in the room where written tests are being conducted for the entire 
duration of the written test 
2. the participants shall not communicate with each other during the test 
3. the participants shall not communicate with any persons via email, telephone, Skype (or similar) or 
social media during the test 
4. the participants shall be allowed to use training material, handouts, and their own notes during the 
test

Technical training 
5. where a participant does not understand the meaning of a question or a multiple- choice option, the 
instructor shall be allowed to help the participant to understand the meaning of the question or the 
multiple-choice options. The instructor shall not give the participants the correct answers to any test 
questions 
6. there shall be a time limit of 1½ minutes per question 
7. the written test questions cannot be used during the training in such a way that the participants could 
recognise that they will be test questions 
8. each participant must answer at least 70% of written test questions correctly to pass the test 
If a participant does not reach the passing criteria in written or observational tests, the instructor shall discuss 
this with the participant to find out the reason. If this is due to a misunderstanding of a question or due to 
language difficulties, then the instructor can mark a question as correct provided that the participants is able 
to demonstrate understanding of the lesson element being tested. This must be documented by the 
instructor and stored with the tests, control measures and evaluations for the course. 
Training providers shall have a documented procedure in place for dealing with participants not meeting the 
stated learning objectives. 
Throughout the entire GWO blade repair course, the instructor will use the participant assessment form (see 
Requirements for Training) to evaluate the participants’ knowledge and skills, with a high focus on evaluating 
the participants’ safety awareness and craftsmanship skills. 
The instructor shall keep a participant assessment form (or adaptation) for each participant until the 
completion / evaluation of the blade repair training module. 
The participant assessment form (or adaptation) is a final evaluation tool for the instructors to assess 
participants during practical elements. It allows measurement of the number of violations regarding safety, 
competency or ability. 
The participant assessment form shall be used as a progressive evaluation tool to discuss the performance of 
a participant to guide them to success. It also serves as supporting documentation if a participant passes or 
fails the module. If a participant fails to meet the demands of the blade repair training module, they can 
attend a new blade repair training in accordance with the contractual agreement when ordering the training 
course. The re-entry point is dictated by the stage where the participant left the course or where the 
instructor deems constructive. 
Training providers may adapt the participant assessment form to other media. Training providers must have a 
documented procedure in place for dealing with participants not meeting the stated learning outcomes.

SAFETY 
Work involving the repair of glass fibre-reinforced composite material carries risks to you and those around 
you. To limit these risks, read and obey the warnings below! 
WARNING 
Obey the manufacturer’s instructions when you use cleaning agents, resins, sealants, fillers, and 
paints. These materials are hazardous to your health and, if used incorrectly, represent a fire hazard. 
Wear the correct personal protective equipment as specified in the safety data sheet for the 
materials that you are working with. The materials used in fibre-reinforced composite repair can 
cause life-changing injuries or death. 
Wear the correct personal protective equipment: eye protection, correct filter dust mask, hearing 
protection, disposable coverall, and the correct gloves for the task when you cut, abrade, or drill 
fibre-reinforced composite materials. The dust from these materials can cause lung injuries and skin 
irritation. These activities create high levels of noise, which can damage your hearing. Flying debris 
from these activities can damage your eyes. 
Environmental conditions 
The materials used in the repair of fibre-reinforced composite materials are sensitive to environmental 
conditions like ambient temperature and humidity. When these materials are used outside of their 
intended temperature and/or humidity range, they may not cure as intended by the manufactur er, leading 
to health risks from uncured material and a loss of material performance resulting in a failure of the repair. 
To limit these risks, read and obey the warning below! 
WARNING 
Obey the environmental conditions described in the Technical Data Sheet for all materials used. 
The ambient temperature and humidity must be recorded using a suitable data logger for the entire 
duration of the repair process. 
Documentation of the repair 
During the repair process, it is of utmost importance to document each stage of the repair with 
photographs, and to include these in a repair report. The repair report must contain, as a minimum:

Repair stage 1 
Preparation 
Gather all documentation, tools and materials that are required for the inspection and repair task. 
Assessment and damage removal 
1) Photograph the initial damage, making sure to include a scale in the photographs to indicate the size 
of the damage. Make a note of any relevant observations that might indicate the root cause of the 
damage 
2) Perform a tap test around the damage to identify the extent of underlying delamination. Mark this 
extent on the blade surface. 
Note 
If the laminate has been in prolonged contact with water, it must be dried before repair 
activities are commenced. 
3) Carefully remove all the damaged material, taking care to not damage underlying structural elements 
like spar caps. 
4) Assess the size of the repair needed, taking into consideration the overlaps required for each layer of 
laminate and the size of the core material (if required). 
Note 
During removal of the damaged material, it may be found that the repair size exceeds the 
ability of the technician performing the repair. In this case, work should stop and the OEM 
contacted for advice on how to proceed. 
5) Carefully grind the existing laminate around the area being repaired, to create overlaps in each layer 
of laminate being repaired. 
6) Clean the repair area with a cleaning agent, ensuring that you remove all dust, debris and oils 
Repair stage 2 
Preparation 
1) Measure the extent of the overlaps and the removed core material created above. Use these 
measurements to carefully cut and shape the repair pieces as required, taking care to ensure the 
correct fibre orientation for each repair layer. 
Note 
A fundamental principle of fibre-reinforced composite repair work is that you should replace 
what you take out. This applies in the case of blade repair work, but you should consult the

=== PAGE 155 ===
Blade Repair Standard / V5 
02052025 
 
Global Wind Organisation©2025 / www.globalwindsafety.org 155 / 164 
 
Technical training 
OEM specific repair instructions and or blade drawings to identify which materials to use for 
the repair task. 
2) Calculate the amount of resin required for each repair layer based upon the weight of the glass -fibre 
and the size of the core material being replaced. Note down the amount for each layer. 
Applying the repair 
WARNING Mixing large quantities of matrix materials can cause a runaway exothermic reaction 
and lead to a fire. Take precautions to avoid an exothermic reaction by only mixing 
sufficient quantities of matrix material for the repair being performed, and, where larg e 
quantities are required, by dividing this into smaller quantities. 
3) For the first repair layer, weigh out and thoroughly mix the matrix material components. 
4) Apply resin to the existing laminate with a paint brush, and carefully apply the first glass fibre repair 
layer. Apply enough resin to fully wet out the glass fibre mat. Carefully roll the mat with a bolt roller to 
ensure complete wet-out of the fibres with matrix and to remove any air bubbles. 
5) For the next repair layer, weigh out and thoroughly mix the matrix material components. 
6) Apply the next repair layer and wet-out as described in step 4. 
7) Continue steps 5 and 6 until all repair layers are applied. 
Note 
If the repair is small and only has a small number of layers, it is possible to mix all the matrix 
material and apply all of the repair layers in one go. Consult the OEM specific instructions 
for the maximum number of layers that can be applied at a time. 
 
Vacuum bagging 
1) Clean the area around the repair and apply flash tape to the blade surface so that it surrounds the 
repair. Ensure that there are no creases or folds in the flash tape. 
2) Apply vacuum sealant tape on top of the flash tape. 
3) Apply peel ply on top of the last laminate repair layer and roll this to remove any air bubbles. 
4) Apply the release film on top of the peel ply. 
5) Apply a thermocouple probe on top of the release film, placing it to the side of the repair so that it 
does not cause an impression in the repair layers. Guide the wires from the thermocouple probe out 
from the repair, and seal with vacuum sealant tape. Connect the wires to the temperature gauge. 
6) Apply the breather fabric on top of the release film. 
7) Cut two lengths of vacuum hose – one for the vacuum pump and one for the vacuum gauge. The 
pieces should be long enough to reach the vacuum pump and gauge. Wrap the repair end of the 
vacuum hose pieces with breather fabric to ensure that they do not become clogged by vacuum film 
or resin.

Technical training 
8) Where the vacuum hoses cross the vacuum sealant tape, additional vacuum sealant tape should be 
applied on top of the hoses to ensure a seal. 
9) Connect the vacuum gauge to one of the vacuum hoses, and attach the other hose to the vacuum 
pump. Use a resin trap between the repair and the vacuum pump. 
10) Apply the vacuum film on top of the repair and press it down onto the vacuum sealant tape. 
11) Start the vacuum pump and check for air leaks around the repair. Consult the OEM -specific instruction 
for the vacuum level to be achieved. 
Curing 
1) Consult the TDS for the matrix material, to ascertain the correct curing temperature and time. 
2) Place a heating blanket over the repair and switch it on. Adjust the temperature of the heating blanket 
until the temperature gauge reaches the correct curing temperature. 
3) Make a note of the time that the temperature gauge reaches the correct temperature – this is the time 
at which the curing duration starts. 
4) Allow the repair to cure for the time specified in the TDS. 
 WARNING The cured vacuum bagging consumables will have sharp edges 
5) After the specified curing time has elapsed, carefully remove the vacuum bagging materials from the 
repair, leaving the peel ply in place. 
6) Verify that the matrix material has reached the specified hardness in the TDS using a Barcol or ShoreD 
tester. 
Filling 
1) Remove the peel ply from the repair, and sand the surface to the required finish as stated in the TDS 
for the filler being used. 
2) Weigh out and mix the filler (if using a two-component filler) 
3) Apply filler to the repair and shape using a plastic scraper so that it matches the surrounding blade 
profile shape. 
4) Allow the filler to cure fully in accordance with the TDS. 
5) After the filler has cured, sand the filler using 120 grit paper so that it matches the surrounding blade 
profile as closely as possible. 
Paint or gelcoat 
1) Consult the OEM specific repair instruction to ascertain whether gelcoat or paint or both are required 
to finish the repair.

Technical training 
2) Clean the filler surface using an appropriate cleaning agent and allow any residual cleaning agent to 
fully evaporate before proceeding. 
Note 
Steps 3 to 6 below will depend on the OEM’s requirements. Consult the OEM specific 
instructions. If the OEM demands both gelcoat and paint, proceed with steps 3 to 6. If the 
OEM only requires paint, omit steps 3 to 5. 
3) Calculate and then weigh out and mix the required amount of gelcoat, and apply this to the filler, 
distributing it evenly and to the specified layer thickness with a plastic scraper. Verify the layer 
thickness using a wet film gauge. 
4) Allow the gelcoat to fully cure in accordance with the TDS. 
5) Sand the gelcoat to the required surface finish in accordance with the TDS for the paint. 
6) Calculate and then weigh out and mix the required amount of paint and apply this to the sanded 
gelcoat, distributing it evenly and to the specified layer thickness using a foam roller. Verify the layer 
thickness with a wet film gauge.

Taxonomy alignment throughout 
The section Understanding GWO learning objectives has been updated to reflect the reviewed GWO 
Taxonomy Framework. 
All learning objectives have been updated with action verbs that reflect the taxonomic levels (basic, 
intermediate, and advanced level) and the domain (knowledge, skills, and ability) without changing the 
content of the element. 
Action verb ‘demonstrate’ in learning objectives is changed to relevant action verb level/domain. 
Learning activity “demonstrate” was changed to ‘practise’ because during training activities, the 
participants are in a learning process and abilities should be trained, not evaluated. 
Learning activities have been aligned to match the updated learning objectives with a focus on participant 
engagement. 
Delegates have been changed to Participants, as participant is the proper designation for a person 
participating in an activity. 
Training staff has been changed to Instructors. 
The instructor’s perspective has been changed to a generic perspective accommodating different types of 
training. 
All instructor guidelines have been compiled in one section under the individual elements. 
More guidelines on the use of feedback have been added to emphasize its importance and ensure its 
effective use by involving the participants. 
All learning objectives have been numbered throughout the standard. 
New learning objectives have been created for all lessons that describe the overall ability the participants 
should acquire during the specific lesson. This focuses the attention on how knowledge and skills support 
the responsible performance of the employee in the context of the job and the deeper involvement 
enables participants to learn and remember more deeply. 
Learning objectives previously positioned at the beginning of a training lesson have been moved to the 
relevant lesson elements and updated with new taxonomic levels (basic, intermediate, and advanced) and 
action verbs that reflect these levels. This makes more evident the connection between the learning 
objectives, the instructor actions, and the participants actions. 
The Introduction lesson for all standards has been updated to ensure alignment between all GWO training 
standards for generic lessons.
