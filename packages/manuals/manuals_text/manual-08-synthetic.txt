1.0 TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
1.1 Coating: Paint, gelcoat, or protective top layer on blade surface.
1.2 Paint loss: Missing or flaking paint exposing primer or substrate.
1.3 Feather edge: Smooth transition from intact coating to bare area without a sharp step.
1.4 Cure: Time and conditions required for coating to reach handling and service hardness.
1.5 Overspray: Unwanted coating deposition beyond repair zone.
2.0 SAFETY
2.1 General
Apply LOTO and confirm turbine is safe to access.
Use respiratory protection when sanding or spraying coatings.
Control overspray and protect surrounding surfaces and environment.
2.2 Stop Criteria (Do not operate if...)
Fibers are exposed over area >25 cm2 or any laminate is visibly damaged.
Coating loss is associated with blistering that indicates underlying delamination (soft tap sound).
Repair cannot be completed to minimum acceptance due to weather conditions (Section 4.3).
2.3 Environmental Limits
Do not apply coatings if surface is wet or if condensation is likely.
Avoid coating when relative humidity is high enough to cause blush or poor adhesion.
If using fast-cure systems, ensure wind does not carry overspray into sensitive areas.
3.0 INSPECTION
3.1 Inspection Objective
Identify coating loss extent, determine whether damage is cosmetic only, and select restoration method.

3.4 Escalation Indicators
Any evidence of laminate involvement: fiber exposure, cracks, soft tap sound.
Blisters around paint loss that expand when pressed gently.
Repeated paint loss in same location within 6 months.
4.0 PROCEDURE
4.1 Tools and Materials
Cleaner, lint-free wipes, masking film
Abrasives: 120, 180, 240, 320 grit
Vacuum or dust removal method
Primer system compatible with blade coating
Top coat system (spray or brush/roller) as approved
Mixing supplies, wet film gauge (if available)
Edge blending pads, polishing compound (if specified)
4.2 Preparation Notes
For P2-P3, the goal is adhesion and smooth runoff. Do not leave sharp coating steps.
Mask a perimeter beyond repair zone to control overspray and create a clean edge.
4.3 Step-by-Step Procedure: Surface Coating Restoration (P2-P3)
Confirm LOTO and safe access. Record turbine state.
Mark repair boundary including at least 30 mm margin beyond visible paint loss.
Clean boundary and surrounding area. Remove insects and residue thoroughly.
Take pre-work photos including scale and span position reference.
Evaluate damage class using Table 3.2. If P4, stop and escalate (Section 3.4).
Remove loose paint at the edges by hand scraping with plastic tool (no metal gouging).
Sand the damaged area with 120-180 grit to remove unstable coating and rough substrate lightly.
Feather the boundary using 240 grit until transition is smooth (no hard edge).
Vacuum and wipe down. Ensure the surface is dry and free of dust.
If bare substrate is present, apply primer as specified. Keep primer within the prepared zone.
Verify primer flash time and dryness before top coat. Do not trap solvent under top coat.
Apply first top coat layer evenly. Use wet film gauge if available to confirm thickness.
Allow tack time then apply second layer if required to achieve coverage and durability.
Remove masking at the correct time to avoid tearing cured edges (follow product guidance).
Allow cure per product specification. Protect from rain and contamination during cure.
Perform finish sanding/blending if needed (320 grit) to match surrounding surface.
Conduct acceptance checks (Section 5.3) and take final photos.
Record materials, batch numbers, ambient conditions, and any deviations.
4.4 Step-by-Step Procedure: Small Spot Repair (P2 quick method)

19) Clean and lightly abrade (240-320 grit) the spot and 20 mm beyond.

20) Apply primer if substrate is exposed.

21) Apply top coat by brush/roller in thin layers; avoid runs.

6.0 TROUBLESHOOTING
6.1 Symptom: Coating craters or fisheyes during application
Likely causes:
Surface contamination (oil/silicone)
Cleaner residue not fully flashed Checks:
Wipe test on adjacent area, inspect for oily sheen Actions:
Stop application, allow flash-off, re-clean, and re-apply with proper prep
6.2 Symptom: Coating remains soft after expected cure time
Likely causes:
Low temperature, high humidity, incorrect mix ratio Checks:
Confirm ambient conditions and mixing records Actions:
Extend cure time if within allowable conditions; if still soft, remove and rework
6.3 Symptom: Repaired patch peels at feather edge after return to service
Likely causes:
Feather edge too abrupt or coating applied over unstable paint Checks:
Inspect peeling boundary and underlying layer integrity Actions:
Re-prep with wider taper, remove unstable layers, re-prime and re-coat
