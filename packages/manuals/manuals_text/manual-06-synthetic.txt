1.0 TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
1.1 Crack: A visible separation in coating or laminate, may be linear or branched.
1.2 Through-coat crack: Crack confined to paint/gelcoat layer.
1.3 Laminate crack: Crack extends into composite laminate.
1.4 Delamination: Separation between laminate layers, often detected by tap testing.
1.5 Bond line: Adhesive joint region (often near trailing edge; cracks can migrate from stress
concentration areas).
1.6 Crack length: Measured along the crack path (not straight line distance).
2.0 SAFETY
2.1 General
Apply LOTO before close inspection and any repair work.
Use cut-resistant gloves when probing crack edges.
Do not grind into suspected structural areas without authorization.
2.2 Stop Criteria (Do not operate if...)
Any crack at or crossing the leading edge with length >100 mm and confirmed laminate involvement.
Any crack accompanied by soft/void sound on tap test over area >100 cm2.
Any crack showing moisture seepage, dark staining, or active propagation (new branching since last
inspection).
Any crack within 0-10% span that is longer than 50 mm (root zone concerns).
3.0 INSPECTION
3.1 Inspection Objective
Distinguish coating cracks from laminate cracks, assess extent, and select appropriate response: monitor,
seal, minor repair, or escalate.
3.2 Crack Classification Table
TABLE 3.2 (ASCII)
Class
Description
Typical Action
C1
Hairline in coating only, <50 mm
Clean, seal, monitor
C2
Coating crack 50-200 mm, no laminate signs
Seal + follow-up inspection
C3
Suspected laminate crack <=100 mm

C4
Laminate crack >100 mm or delamination signs
Stop and escalate
3.3 Inspection Methods
Visual under angled light and magnification (if available)
Crack edge probe with plastic pick (no metal scraping)
Tap test: coin or small hammer; compare with adjacent area
Moisture indicator check if staining is present

Crack length (mm), max opening (mm), any branching
Tap test boundary (drawn outline), moisture/staining notes
Photo set: overview, close-up with scale, close-up at 45 degrees, tap test boundary photo
4.0 PROCEDURE
4.1 Procedure Overview
This procedure provides steps for crack assessment and two field responses: sealing/coating crack
containment and minor laminate repair for small cracks. For C4, escalate.
4.2 Tools and Materials
Cleaner, lint-free wipes
Abrasives: 180, 240, 320 grit
Plastic pick, flexible ruler, marker
Sealant compatible with coating system (for C1-C2)
Patch resin system (for limited laminate repair), mixing supplies
Peel ply (optional), small vacuum bag kit if approved
Paint/finish materials for top coat restoration
4.3 Step-by-Step Procedure: Assessment (All crack classes)
Confirm turbine is safe and locked out. Record turbine state.
Locate the crack and mark its ends with a fine marker.
Clean the area gently. Remove dirt that can hide crack branching.
Photograph overview and close-up with scale before any sanding.
Measure crack length along path. Record max opening if visible.
Probe crack edge with plastic pick. Note if edges are raised or if material flakes.
Perform tap test in a grid around the crack (approx 50 mm spacing). Mark any dull-sounding boundary.
If staining/moisture suspected, wipe and observe if fluid reappears. Note odor and color (do not taste).
Classify crack per Table 3.2 and decide response path:
IF C1 or C2 THEN proceed to Section 4.4.
IF C3 THEN proceed to Section 4.5.
IF C4 THEN proceed to Section 4.6.
4.4 Step-by-Step Procedure: Seal and Contain (C1-C2)

10) Sand lightly along the crack line (320 grit) to open the surface for sealant adhesion (do not widen crack
aggressively).

11) Clean sanding dust and allow surface to dry fully.

12) Apply sealant along crack using controlled bead. Work it into the crack with a plastic spreader.

13) Remove excess sealant and feather edges for smooth runoff.

14) Allow cure per product spec. Protect from rain during cure.


15) Apply touch-up coating if required. Confirm the surface is smooth to the hand.

16) Document final photos and schedule follow-up inspection within 30-90 days (depending on span
location and crack length).
4.5 Step-by-Step Procedure: Minor Laminate Repair (C3)

17) Define repair boundary: at least 30 mm beyond crack ends and 20 mm to each side.

18) Sand the boundary to remove coating down to laminate where required. Create a smooth taper (no
sharp steps).

19) Clean thoroughly. Ensure no moisture is trapped; if moisture suspected, stop and escalate.

20) Prepare resin system and reinforcement per approved kit. Do not substitute materials without
approval.

21) Apply resin and reinforcement to bridge crack zone. Maintain leading edge contour; avoid creating a
ridge.

22) If peel ply is used, apply and compress to remove excess resin and improve surface finish.

23) Allow cure. Verify cure by hardness check (no tack, stable under light pressure).

24) Sand cured patch flush (240-320 grit) and restore protective coating.

25) Perform tap test on repaired zone and adjacent area. Confirm no new dull areas formed.

26) Complete documentation: measurements, photos, batch numbers, ambient conditions.
4.6 Escalation and Temporary Measures (C4)

27) Stop work. Do not grind or drill.

28) Mark boundaries of suspected delamination and crack ends clearly.

29) Capture detailed photos including tap test boundary.

30) Notify supervisor and request engineering review and OEM work instruction.

31) If approved, apply temporary environmental seal only (thin sealant coat) to prevent moisture ingress;
do not claim structural restoration.

6.0 TROUBLESHOOTING
6.1 Symptom: Crack reappears through sealant after cure
Likely causes:
Crack is moving (laminate involvement)
Sealant not compatible or poor surface prep Checks:
Inspect for branching; repeat tap test Actions:
Reclassify. IF signs of laminate or delamination THEN escalate (Section 4.6).
If coating-only, remove sealant, re-prep, re-apply with proper primer if specified.
6.2 Symptom: Repair patch forms a ridge that catches water
Likely causes:
Excess resin or insufficient sanding Checks:
Visual and hand check along airflow direction Actions:
Sand and feather edges, restore coating, re-check contour.
6.3 Symptom: Dull tap sound appears after sanding
Likely causes:
Delamination exposed or extended by aggressive grinding Checks:
Map dull area boundary Actions:
Stop and escalate. Document boundary and avoid further material removal.
