1.0 TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
1.1 Leading edge: The forward-most blade edge facing oncoming flow.
1.2 Erosion: Material loss or surface roughening due to rain, particles, or contamination.
1.3 LEP: Leading edge protection (tape or coating applied to reduce further wear).
1.4 Span position: Location along blade length expressed as percent of span (0% at root, 100%
at tip).
1.5 Repair class: Categorization used to select action pathway (see Table 3.2).
2.0 SAFETY
2.1 General
Follow site permit-to-work and rescue plan requirements.
Verify turbine state and lockout/tagout before accessing blade surfaces.
Use fall protection and tether tools to prevent dropped objects.
2.2 Stop Criteria (Do not operate if...)
Do not return turbine to service if any of the following are observed:

Exposed structural fibers over an area larger than 50 cm2.

Leading edge material is missing to a depth greater than 3 mm over a continuous length greater than 300
mm.

Any crack (through-coat or laminate) intersecting the leading edge with length greater than 100 mm (refer
to Manual 2 for crack handling).

Loose or lifting protection tape longer than 200 mm that cannot be re-adhered and sealed (risk of peel
propagation).
2.3 Chemical and Dust Controls
Wear respirator suitable for composite dust during sanding.
Use gloves and eye protection when handling solvents, primers, and adhesives.
Keep ignition sources away from solvent vapors.
3.0 INSPECTION
3.1 Inspection Objective
Identify leading edge wear, measure severity, document location and extent, and determine if temporary
protection or minor repair is appropriate.

3.3 Required Measurements and Reporting Fields
Turbine ID, blade ID, date/time, weather conditions
Turbine state (stopped, feathered, locked out)
Span position range (e.g., 20-60% span), side (pressure/suction), edge (leading)
Damage length (mm), max width (mm), estimated depth (mm)
Photo set: overview, close-up perpendicular, close-up angled, measurement scale visible
Notes on contamination (insects, salt, dust), tape condition (if present)
3.4 Inspection Method
Perform an overview scan from 0-100% span focusing on 20-60% span where wear is most common.
Identify and mark areas of roughness or coat loss.
Clean a small test area with approved cleaner to confirm if discoloration is surface contamination or material
loss.
Measure and record damage dimensions using a flexible ruler and depth gauge (or comparative step gauge).
4.0 PROCEDURE
4.1 Procedure Overview
This procedure covers cleaning, preparation, application of temporary protection, and minor repair for erosion
classes E1-E3. For E4, follow Section 4.4.
4.2 Materials and Tools
Approved surface cleaner (non-residue), lint-free wipes
Abrasives: 120, 180, 240 grit
Masking tape, measuring tools, marker pencil
LEP tape kit or field-applied protective film (as specified by site)
Edge sealant compatible with tape system
Filler/putty (non-structural) for shallow erosion pits
Primer (if required by tape system), mixing supplies
Roller/squeegee, heat gun (low setting), IR thermometer
4.3 Step-by-Step Procedure (E1-E3)
Verify lockout/tagout and turbine state. Record turbine state in the work log.
Confirm weather limits: do not apply tape if surface is wet or if steady wind prevents controlled work.
Mark the repair zone with masking tape boundaries. Include at least 30 mm margin beyond visible wear.
Clean the zone using approved cleaner and lint-free wipes. Repeat until wipe shows minimal residue.
Inspect the cleaned surface under angled light to identify pits and coat loss edges.
Measure and record length/width/depth and span position. Take the required photo set (Section 3.3).
For E2-E3: Feather sanding. Use 180 grit to remove loose coating and create a smooth taper at the boundary
(no sharp steps).
Vacuum and wipe down. Confirm no dust remains. Allow solvents to flash off fully.
If pits exceed 1 mm depth (E3): Apply non-structural filler to pits only. Do not build a thick layer. Smooth to
profile.
Allow filler cure per product instructions. Verify cure by fingernail test (no tack, no indentation).

Sand cured filler flush with surrounding surface (240 grit). Maintain original leading edge contour.
If required by tape system: Apply primer to the prepared zone. Allow to dry as specified.
Dry-fit LEP tape. Confirm alignment along leading edge and verify overlap margins.
Apply tape from center outward using a squeegee/roller to avoid trapped air. Use firm pressure.
Work tape edges with a roller. If temperature is low, gently warm the tape (low heat) to improve
conformability.
Seal tape edges with compatible edge sealant. Apply a continuous bead along both tape edges.
Remove masking and check for lifted corners, wrinkles, or air pockets. Rework immediately if found.
Record completion photos: overview and two close-ups showing edge sealant continuity.
Document materials batch numbers, ambient temperature, and humidity estimate if available.
Release turbine only after acceptance checks (Section 5.3) are passed.
4.4 Escalation Procedure (E4 or Uncertain)
Stop work and notify supervisor.
Capture detailed photos with scale.
Tag the location and record span position to nearest 1%.
Do not apply tape over exposed fibers without explicit instruction.
Recommend follow-up with structural repair team.

6.0 TROUBLESHOOTING
6.1 Symptom: Tape edges lift within minutes of application
Likely causes:
Surface contamination (oil, moisture)
Insufficient edge pressure or temperature too low Checks:
Wipe test on adjacent area; check for condensation Actions:
Remove tape, re-clean, allow drying time, re-apply with gentle warming and increased edge rolling
Apply edge sealant only after adhesion is confirmed
6.2 Symptom: Air bubbles form under tape after application
Likely causes:
Application from one side without center-out method
Surface texture too rough Checks:
Measure bubble size and location Actions:
For bubbles <10 mm: work with roller toward edge
For bubbles >=10 mm: lift and re-lay while warming; if cannot be corrected, replace tape section
6.3 Symptom: Filler remains tacky beyond expected cure time
Likely causes:
Incorrect mixing ratio or low temperature Checks:
Confirm ambient temperature and mix method Actions:
Remove uncured filler, re-prep surface, remix properly, and cure within specified temperature range
