      "summary": "Over the 6-hour window the turbine ran in consistently strong wind (~18 m/s, low variability, peaks to ~20 m/s) while electrical output stayed nearly constant near rated power with minimal fluctuation. Rotor speed was essentially steady (generator RPM showed only minor variation), pitch averaged ~15 deg and yaw offset was about 8 deg, with all status flags normal. Ambient/operating temperature was elevated and the mean power residual was negative (~-0.13), indicating produced power was consistently below expected."
