SCOPE Global Wind Organisation is a non-profit body founded by the wind turbine manufacturers and owners. Our members strive for an injury free work environment in the wind turbine industry, setting common international standards for safety training and emergency procedures. This standard describes the requirements for blade repair training that are recommended by the members of GWO. The standard comprises of one module. GWO recognises trained persons as competent within blade repair in the wind industry. GWO accepts the trained person as possessing the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to stop an unsafe work situation where they, as duty holders, are accountable for safety. This standard has been developed in response to the demand for recognisable blade repair training in the industry and has been prepared in co-operation between the members of GWO based on risk assessments, in-depth descriptions of job roles and tasks relevant to blade repair in the wind industry as well as factual incident and accident statistics from G+ and the wind industry. Training is verified through GWO\u2019s WINDA database. General feedback on this document can be sent to info@globalwindsafety.org See globalwindsafety.org on how to raise a complaint about a training provider or report a safety incident occurring during training. 5. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE GWO BLADE REPAIR Upon completion of the GWO Blade Repair Standard (BR), participants will be aware of the risks and hazards encountered when working with blade inspection and repair within the wind industry. Furthermore, they will be able to control and mitigate those risks and hazards. The GWO Blade Repair Standard training will also equip participants with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to appropriately respond in the event of a hazardous situation and to increase their safety through proper use of personal protective equipment, emergency equipment, procedur es and safe craftsmanship. 5.1 Target Group Personnel who will be working in the wind industry, specifically in relation to composite inspection and repair work. Personnel that perform job functions (that have been risk assessed by their employer or their workplace duty holder) that are defined as functions where composite work training, according to this standard, may mitigate some of the identified hazards and risks. 5.2 Aims and Objectives Training in accordance with this standard will enable participants to support and care for themselves and others working in the wind industry by possessing the knowledge and skills of composite inspection and repair work. Upon completion of the GWO Blade Repair Standard training course, participants will be able to work safely with composite materials while conducting inspection and basic blade repair procedures, thereby"

Act as first responder in the case of an accident Supporting staff: 1. A person with a valid first aid qualification shall be present during all practical training. This can be the instructor or an assigned emergency response team 6.2 Practical Training Facilities All facilities shall be maintained and, where appropriate, inspected and tested in accordance with current national legislation and manufacturers\u2019 specification. It is recommended that the facilities reach European standards. Risk assessments shall be conducted and documented for all training facilities. The training provider shall hold the required permits to operate the facilities. The learning process is facilitated by comparable elements, comparing the training environment and the participants\u2019 working environment. Comparable elements enhance the application of what is learned. The practical training facilities and the training environment are therefore expected to incorporate as many elements comparable to a real wind turbine working environment as is reasonably practicable. The practical training facility should enable each participant to, individually and/or as part of a team, see, hear and practise the taught subject matter in such a way that it resembles the working practices in a real wind turbine environment. The following training facility items will be required for the blade repair training: A workshop area with sufficient: 1. dust extraction to ensure that the amount of dust in the air is kept below 10 milligrams per cubic metre 2. filtration of extracted air to prevent environmental contamination 3. exposure control measures to limit exposure limits for the instructor and participants to those as stated in the safety data sheet for all materials being used 4. temperature and humidity control to ensure that all materials being used are used within the usage limits specified in the technical data sheet for those materials 5. segregation from classrooms and administrative areas to prevent cross contamination of chemicals 6. waste segregation to prevent cross contamination The training provider must ensure that chemical waste is disposed of in accordance with national legislation. The training provider must provide a changing area between workshop areas and clean areas like classrooms and administration areas where participants and staff can change their shoes to prevent contamination of clean areas with chemicals."

USING THIS STANDARD TO DEVELOP TRAINING The training in this standard is designed around the GWO taxonomy described in the GWO Requirements for Training. Theoretical and practical activities must be delivered according to the defined taxonomic level in order to reach the described learning objectives. When teaching equipment, a generic approach shall be applied aiming to avoid additional potential product specific formal training after completion of this training. However, national or regional legislation, company gap analysis and location specific risk assessments may require additional product specific familiarisation which is the responsibility of the duty holder. In addition to this, all training based on this standard including all related resources shall, as a minimum, meet the requirements described in the GWO Requirements for Training. 8. ADMINISTRATION AND CERTIFICATION OF MODULE 8.1 Participant Performance Assessment Participants will be assessed by means of direct observation and supplementary oral questions where appropriate (formative evaluation). The participants will also be subjected to written phase tests after theory elements, and again after the close of the training course (summative evaluation). The written tests can consist of multiple choice or descriptive answer questions and shall be set at the same taxonomy level as the objective that they are testing. There shall be at least one question for each lesson in the module. The written tests shall be conducted in accordance with the following criteria: 1. there shall be an instructor present in the room where written tests are being conducted for the entire duration of the written test 2. the participants shall not communicate with each other during the test 3. the participants shall not communicate with any persons via email, telephone, Skype (or similar) or social media during the test 4. the participants shall be allowed to use training material, handouts, and their own notes during the test Blade Repair Standard / V5 02052025 Global Wind Organisation\u00a92025 / www.globalwindsafety.org 10 / 164 Technical training 5. where a participant does not understand the meaning of a question or a multiple- choice option, the instructor shall be allowed to help the participant to understand the meaning of the question or the multiple-choice options.

If this is due to a misunderstanding of a question or due to language difficulties, then the instructor can mark a question as correct provided that the participants is able to demonstrate understanding of the lesson element being tested. This must be documented by the instructor and stored with the tests, control measures and evaluations for the course. Training providers shall have a documented procedure in place for dealing with participants not meeting the stated learning objectives. Throughout the entire GWO blade repair course, the instructor will use the participant assessment form (see Requirements for Training) to evaluate the participants\u2019 knowledge and skills, with a high focus on evaluating the participants\u2019 safety awareness and craftsmanship skills. The instructor shall keep a participant assessment form (or adaptation) for each participant until the completion / evaluation of the blade repair training module. The participant assessment form (or adaptation) is a final evaluation tool for the instructors to assess participants during practical elements. It allows measurement of the number of violations regarding safety, competency or ability. The participant assessment form shall be used as a progressive evaluation tool to discuss the performance of a participant to guide them to success. It also serves as supporting documentation if a participant passes or fails the module. If a participant fails to meet the demands of the blade repair training module, they can attend a new blade repair training in accordance with the contractual agreement when ordering the training course. The re-entry point is dictated by the stage where the participant left the course or where the instructor deems constructive. Training providers may adapt the participant assessment form to other media.

Assessment and damage removal 1) Photograph the initial damage, making sure to include a scale in the photographs to indicate the size of the damage. Make a note of any relevant observations that might indicate the root cause of the damage 2) Perform a tap test around the damage to identify the extent of underlying delamination. Mark this extent on the blade surface. Note If the laminate has been in prolonged contact with water, it must be dried before repair activities are commenced. 3) Carefully remove all the damaged material, taking care to not damage underlying structural elements like spar caps. 4) Assess the size of the repair needed, taking into consideration the overlaps required for each layer of laminate and the size of the core material (if required). Note During removal of the damaged material, it may be found that the repair size exceeds the ability of the technician performing the repair. In this case, work should stop and the OEM contacted for advice on how to proceed. 5) Carefully grind the existing laminate around the area being repaired, to create overlaps in each layer of laminate being repaired. 6) Clean the repair area with a cleaning agent, ensuring that you remove all dust, debris and oils Repair stage 2 Preparation 1) Measure the extent of the overlaps and the removed core material created"

Use these measurements to carefully cut and shape the repair pieces as required, taking care to ensure the correct fibre orientation for each repair layer. Note A fundamental principle of fibre-reinforced composite repair work is that you should replace what you take out. This applies in the case of blade repair work, but you should consult the Blade Repair Standard / V5 02052025 Global Wind Organisation\u00a92025 / www.globalwindsafety.org 155 / 164 Technical training OEM specific repair instructions and or blade drawings to identify which materials to use for the repair task. 2) Calculate the amount of resin required for each repair layer based upon the weight of the glass -fibre and the size of the core material being replaced. Note down the amount for each layer. Applying the repair WARNING Mixing large quantities of matrix materials can cause a runaway exothermic reaction and lead to a fire. Take precautions to avoid an exothermic reaction by only mixing sufficient quantities of matrix material for the repair being performed, and, where larg e quantities are required, by dividing this into smaller quantities. 3) For the first repair layer, weigh out and thoroughly mix the matrix material components. 4) Apply resin to the existing laminate with a paint brush, and carefully apply the first glass fibre repair layer. Apply enough resin to fully wet out the glass fibre mat. Carefully roll the mat with a bolt roller to ensure complete wet-out of the fibres with matrix and to remove any air bubbles. 5) For the next repair layer, weigh out and thoroughly mix the matrix material components. 6) Apply the next repair layer and wet-out as described in step 4. 7) Continue steps 5 and 6 until all repair layers are applied. Note If the repair is small and only has a small number of layers, it is possible to mix all the matrix material and apply all of the repair layers in one go. Consult the OEM specific instructions for the maximum number of layers that can be applied at a time. Vacuum bagging 1) Clean the area around the repair and apply flash tape to the blade surface so that it surrounds the repair. Ensure that there are no creases or folds in the flash tape. 2) Apply vacuum sealant"

Ensure that there are no creases or folds in the flash tape. 2) Apply vacuum sealant tape on top of the flash tape. 3) Apply peel ply on top of the last laminate repair layer and roll this to remove any air bubbles. 4) Apply the release film on top of the peel ply. 5) Apply a thermocouple probe on top of the release film, placing it to the side of the repair so that it does not cause an impression in the repair layers. Guide the wires from the thermocouple probe out from the repair, and seal with vacuum sealant tape. Connect the wires to the temperature gauge. 6) Apply the breather fabric on top of the release film. 7) Cut two lengths of vacuum hose \u2013 one for the vacuum pump and one for the vacuum gauge. The pieces should be long enough to reach the vacuum pump and gauge. Wrap the repair end of the vacuum hose pieces with breather fabric to ensure that they do not become clogged by vacuum film or resin. Blade Repair Standard / V5 02052025 Global Wind Organisation\u00a92025 / www.globalwindsafety.org 156 / 164 Technical training 8) Where the vacuum hoses cross the vacuum sealant tape, additional vacuum sealant tape should be applied on top of the hoses to ensure a seal. 9) Connect the vacuum gauge to one of the vacuum hoses, and attach the other hose to the vacuum pump. Use a resin trap between the repair and the vacuum pump. 10) Apply the vacuum film on top of the repair and press it down onto the vacuum sealant tape. 11) Start the vacuum pump and check for air leaks around the repair. Consult the OEM -specific instruction for the vacuum level to be achieved. Curing 1) Consult the TDS for the matrix material, to ascertain the correct curing temperature and time. 2) Place a heating blanket over the repair and switch it on. Adjust the temperature of the heating blanket until the temperature gauge reaches the correct curing temperature. 3) Make a note of the time that the temperature gauge reaches the correct temperature \u2013 this is the time at which the curing duration starts. 4) Allow the repair to cure for the time specified in the TDS.

WARNING The cured vacuum bagging consumables will have sharp edges 5) After the specified curing time has elapsed, carefully remove the vacuum bagging materials from the repair, leaving the peel ply in place. 6) Verify that the matrix material has reached the specified hardness in the TDS using a Barcol or ShoreD tester. Filling 1) Remove the peel ply from the repair, and sand the surface to the required finish as stated in the TDS for the filler being used. 2) Weigh out and mix the filler (if using a two-component filler) 3) Apply filler to the repair and shape using a plastic scraper so that it matches the surrounding blade profile shape. 4) Allow the filler to cure fully in accordance with the TDS. 5) After the filler has cured, sand the filler using 120 grit paper so that it matches the surrounding blade profile as closely as possible. Paint or gelcoat 1) Consult the OEM specific repair instruction to ascertain whether gelcoat or paint or both are required to finish the repair. Blade Repair Standard / V5 02052025 Global Wind Organisation\u00a92025 / www.globalwindsafety.org 157 / 164 Technical training 2) Clean the filler surface using an appropriate cleaning agent and allow any residual cleaning agent to fully evaporate before proceeding. Note Steps 3 to 6 below will depend on the OEM\u2019s requirements. Consult the OEM specific instructions. If the OEM demands both gelcoat and paint, proceed with steps 3 to 6. If the OEM only requires paint, omit steps 3 to 5. 3) Calculate and then weigh out and mix the required amount of gelcoat, and apply this to the filler, distributing it evenly and to the specified layer thickness with a plastic scraper. Verify the layer thickness using a wet film gauge. 4) Allow the gelcoat to fully cure in accordance with the TDS. 5) Sand the gelcoat to the required surface finish in accordance with the TDS for the paint. 6) Calculate and then weigh out and mix the required amount of paint and apply this to the sanded gelcoat, distributing it evenly and to the specified layer thickness using a foam roller.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The Bergey EXCEL 15 is an upwind horizontal-axis wind turbine designed for distributed generation applications, connected to the power grid on the customer\u2019s side of the utility meter. The complete unit consists of the following major components, as shown in the figure below: 1. Spinner 6. Tail Assembly 2. PowerFlex\u00ae Rotor Blades 7. Slip-Rings 3. Alternator 8. Yaw Bearing Assembly 4. Mainframe 9. Powersync\u00ae III Inverter 5. Back-up Braking 10. Auxiliary Load (not shown) Spinner PowerFlex\u00ae Rotor Blades Alternator Back-up BrakingMainframe T ail Assembly Slip-Rings Powersync\u00ae III Inverter Yaw Bearing Assembly Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 7 A. SPINNER The spinner (nose cone) is purely cosmetic. B. ROTOR SYSTEM The rotor system consists of three high-technology carbon-fiber PowerFlex\u00ae blades. Acting like aircraft wings, the blades convert the energy of the wind into rotational forces that drive the alternator. The PowerFlex\u00ae blades are rigidly attached to the alternator and they are fixed pitch. The Excel 15 rotor blades have proprietary airfoils, which were custom designed to provide high efficiency and low noise. Each blade has a serial number inscribed on its root pad at the inboard end. C. ALTERNATOR The alternator converts the rotational energy of the rotor into electricity. The alternator utilizes permanent magnets and has an inverted configuration in that the outside housing rotates, while the internal windings are stationary. It was specifically designed for the Bergey EXCEL 15 and produces power at low speeds, eliminating the need for a speed-increasing gearbox. Since it uses permanent magnets, the alternator is generating voltage whenever the rotor is turning. DANGER The output wiring of the EXCEL 15 presents a shock hazard whenever the rotor is turning. Caution must be exercised at all times to avoid electrical shock. D. MAINFRAME The mainframe is the structural backbone of the wind turbine. It serves as the attachment point for the rotor/alternator assembly,"

DANGER The output wiring of the EXCEL 15 presents a shock hazard whenever the rotor is turning. Caution must be exercised at all times to avoid electrical shock. D. MAINFRAME The mainframe is the structural backbone of the wind turbine. It serves as the attachment point for the rotor/alternator assembly, the tail assembly, the yaw bearing assembly. It also houses the yaw-axis slip-ring assembly and the controls for the back- up braking system. E. BACK-UP BRAKING The back-up braking system is an added safety system that prevents rotor overspeed in the event of a failure of the primary speed control system (inverter and dump load). Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 8 F. TAIL ASSEMBLY The tail assembly keeps the rotor aligned into the wind. G. SLIP-RING ASSEMBLY The slip-rings and brushes conduct the electricity generated in the alternator from the moving (as it orients with the direction) wind turbine to the fixed tower wiring. The slip- rings are enclosed in the steel mainframe housing to help protect them from the weather and lightning. H. YAW BEARING ASSEMBLY The yaw bearing assembly allows the turbine to freely align itself to the wind direction. I. POWERSYNC III INVERTER The Powersync III inverter converts the \u201cvariable AC\u201d from the Bergey EXCEL 15 turbine into utility grade electricity so that it can be connected to the wiring in your home or business. This conversion requires sophisticated electronics and is designed to operate automatically. The Powersync III has a digital display that provides information on the status of the system, its current output power, and its cumulative energy production. The system also includes an auxiliary load bank that absorbs excess wind energy during strong wind gusts. Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 9 IV. SYSTEM OPERATION A. NORMAL OPERATION The Bergey EXCEL 15 produces utility compatible power in the form of 240VAC, 60 Hz, single phase electricity (other voltage options are available). It is connected through the Powersync\u00ae III inverter to the utility distribution network in the same manner as household appliances or electrical machinery. When the wind speed is too low to operate the wind turbine, all of the electrical power needed for the home or business will be supplied by the utility company. During these idle periods the Powersync\u00ae III will consume approximately 0.3 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day. When the system begins producing power, the amount of power which must be purchased from the utility is reduced by an amount equal to the output of the wind system. From the perspective of the utility company the wind system output"

During these idle periods the Powersync\u00ae III will consume approximately 0.3 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day. When the system begins producing power, the amount of power which must be purchased from the utility is reduced by an amount equal to the output of the wind system. From the perspective of the utility company the wind system output reduces the electrical load they have to supply, just as if you turned off lights and appliances. The output of the wind system fluctuates with the speed of the wind so the instantaneous amount of electricity being saved will be constantly changing. Quite often your home will be served simultaneously by the utility and your Bergey wind turbine. When the output of the wind system exceeds the power requirements of the house the excess electricity is sent back to the utility. Both the consumer\u2019s right to interconnect a wind system and the utilities obligation to purchase excess power are prescribed by federal law (PURPA, Section 210). The amount you will be credited or paid for this excess production varies state-to-state and sometimes utility-to-utility. If your utility company offers \u201cnet metering\u201d then your meter is allowed to turn backwards so that you essentially bank energy, at full value, for less windy periods. This banking can be done over a month or over a year depending on the policy of your state or your utility. If you do not get \u201cnet metering\u201d then you will have a second utility meter to register excess production and your utility will pay or credit you for this, typically at less than the rate you pay when you purchase their electricity. If your utility experiences an outage (blackout) the wind system will cease to produce power so that it does not present an electrical safety hazard to utility repair crews. During a power outage the Excel 15 turbine will come to a stop. When utility power is restored, the Powersync III will automatically return the wind system to full working status following a five minute delay and then a two minute countdown. These time delays are dictated in the UL standards required by the utilities. The rotor of the EXCEL 15 should begin to rotate when the wind speed reaches approximately 9 mph (4 m/s). Once started, the rotor may continue to turn in winds below 5 mph (2.2 m/s), but the system will not be producing power below this wind speed. Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 10 NOTE All operational wind speeds given assume steady winds, sea-level conditions and moderate temperatures. Hot weather, high altitude, turbulence and gusting winds will reduce system performance."

Once started, the rotor may continue to turn in winds below 5 mph (2.2 m/s), but the system will not be producing power below this wind speed. Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 10 NOTE All operational wind speeds given assume steady winds, sea-level conditions and moderate temperatures. Hot weather, high altitude, turbulence and gusting winds will reduce system performance. NOTE The Excel 15 may exhibit poor start-up performance in light steady winds. The design of the blades is optimized for efficiency and storm protection, which necessitated some sacrifice in start-up characteristics. The rotor speed will increase with increasing wind speed and the system will produce a higher output. This output increases rapidly because the energy available in the wind varies as the third power (cube) of the wind speed. For example, if the wind speed increased form 5 mph to 10 mph, a factor of two, the energy in the wind would increase from one unit to eight units, a factor of eight (2 to the 3rd power). One result of this relationship is that there is very little energy available in light winds. For the average site, winds in the range of 12-20 mph (5.5 \u2013 9 m/s) will provide most of the system\u2019s energy production on an annual basis. The Excel 15 will operate at variable speed up to about 20 mph (9 m/s) and about 150 RPM. The speed of the rotor is controlled to limit at about 150 RPM. B. HIGH WINDS Unlike previous Bergey wind turbines, the Excel 15 does not furl (rotor turned away from the wind). The Excel 15 controls speed and protects itself from high winds by stalling the rotor progressively as wind speeds increase. In sustained high winds the rotor speed is reduced to limit power surges during strong gusts. C. PROBLEMS WITH POWER GRID If an abnormal condition occurs on the utility line, such as a voltage fluctuation or a complete interruption, the Powersync III inverter will automatically disconnect the wind turbine from the power grid and bring the rotor to a stop. D. EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN The Bergey EXCEL 15 is designed for unattended operation over an extended period of time. Exceptional situations may occur, however, in which the wind turbine should be shutdown. These situations include: 1. EXCESSIVE VIBRATION - Uneven ice build-up, ice shedding, or blade damage may cause the wind turbine to experience excessive vibration. Always shut the turbine down as soon as an increase in vibration is detected. Any new or excessive vibration in the turbine when ice is not present should be investigated immediately. 2. UNUSUAL SOUND - If the turbine begins making clinking,"

UNUSUAL SOUND - If the turbine begins making clinking, growling, or other unusual sound it Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 11 should be shut down and fully inspected as soon as possible. 3. INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE - Whenever someone must climb the tower the wind turbine must be shut down. Shut down of the EXCEL 15 is accomplished by operating (pressing) the red Emergency Stop button on the Powersync III inverter. To release the Emergency Stop, turn the red button clockwise until it snaps outward. This will resume automatic operation of the wind turbine. WARNING: Do not open the disconnect switch on the tower during shutdown. This would allow the turbine to restart and if the turbine tried to overspeed it would trigger the back-up braking system. E. BACK-UP BRAKING SYSTEM If the primary overspeed protection system fails, the Excel 15 has a back-up braking system located on the wind turbine. It detects an overspeed situation and applies a dynamic brake to bring the rotor to a near stop. You can tell this has occurred if the Powersync III display says \u201cWaiting for wind\u201d and there\u2019s plenty of wind [greater than 15 mph (6.7 m/s)], but the rotor does not turn. It will automatically reset if the wind drops below 2 m/s (4.5 mph). Otherwise, you can manually restart the turbine by activating and then restoring the Emergency Stop button on the Powersync III inverter. If activation of the Back-up Brake occurs repeatedly we strongly recommend that you contact your dealer or the Service Department at BWC. Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 12 V. POWERSYNC III INVERTER The Powersync III inverter is connected to the household or building electrical circuits through a dedicated circuit breaker. Before opening the Powersync III enclosure, the breaker must be turned off and the turbine Emergency Stop must be activated, to avoid electrical shock. DANGER Electric Shock Hazard. Failure to comply will result in death or serious injury. Disconnect all power to the inverter before servicing. Wait at least 5 minutes before opening the inverter door.

Contact your distributor or BWC for application specific lightning surge suppression solutions. E. Inverter Operation This equipment is a UL 1741 certified1 Utility Interactive Inverter and complies with the requirements of IEEE1547 which is the standard for interconnecting distributed resources with electric power systems. It will not operate in an off-grid or backup power configuration. The normal operation of the inverter is as follows: When single phase utility power is applied to the output of the inverter, the display will power up and a message stating that the unit is initializing is shown. If there are no faults, i.e. grid voltage and frequency are in tolerance, a countdown timer set for 5 minutes (300 seconds) starts before the inverter is ready to transfer power to the utility grid. The inverter will automatically transfer power to the utility when AC voltages in the range of 30VAC to 600VAC are present at the Turbine input. As the heatsink heats up after exporting significant power for a period of time the internal cooling fans will activate. The inverter is be able to operate at full power continuously if provided with adequate ventilation and the local ambient temperature stays below 45\u00baC (113\u00baF). If the ventilation is compromised or the heatsink temperature exceeds 60\u00b0C, the inverter will automatically reduce its output power. F. Touch Screen Display The touch screen display located on the front panel of the enclosure provides manual over-ride and status of the inverter\u2019s operation. The touch screen display also provides a Stop and a Reset button. The Stop button is used when it is desired to disconnect the inverter from the power grid and the wind turbine. After Stop is pressed the inverter will remain in a powered-up stand-by mode until Reset is pressed or Grid voltage is removed. When Reset is pressed the inverter will resume normal operation. The status of the inverter\u2019s operation is shown on the lines one and two of the display. The following table lists the status messages that may appear. Status Message Description Waiting Initializing The inverter has been reset or that the 5 minute countdown delay is in progress Waiting For Wind The voltage from the turbine is lower than the factory set auto- start voltage threshold AC Running The active rectifier is regulating the internal DC Boost voltage Running The inverter is transferring power to the utility grid Fault A fault has occurred.

Frequent code 10 faults indicate that the unit should be returned to BWC for service. DC OVER VOLT 1 1000 The DC Bus voltage has exceeded its maximum threshold. This occurs if the input power exceeds the output power. This may occur in exceptionally high winds especially if the OV Power limit is active or temperature throttling is occurring. DC OVER VOLT 2 1500 The DC Input voltage has exceeded its maximum threshold. This may occur in exceptionally high wind conditions. DC UNDER VOLT 1250 The internal DC Boost voltage has dropped below its minimum threshold. This usually indicates a configuration problem and is normally never seen. AC OVER VOLT 2030 The AC line voltage has exceeded its maximum threshold. This occurs if OV limiting was not able to influence the high grid voltage. If this happens routinely consider increasing the output wire gage or making arrangements with the utility to upgrade their distribution transformer. AC UNDER VOLT 2280 The AC line voltage has dropped below its minimum threshold. It is normal to see this when the inverter has been disconnected from the grid. It may also occur momentarily when large equipment is turned on nearby. TURBINE PHASE 2500 Indicates that there is a problem with one or more of the turbine input phases. Bad connection, shorted or missing phase. When the inverter detects excessive ripple on the DC input, it shuts down to protect the turbine from destructive vibration. OVER CURRENT 3000 Phase A line current sensed by the converter module has exceeded its maximum current threshold. This may indicate that current is returning on the earth ground wire. OVER CURRENT 3020 Phase C line current sensed by the converter module has exceeded its maximum current threshold. This may indicate that current is returning on the earth ground wire.

This UL standard also dictates high and low limits for utility voltage and frequency, outside of which the inverter is required to shut down until they return to the acceptable range. This is called a FAULT condition. There are a number of possible FAULT conditions during which the Powersync III will be protecting itself or the power grid. When a FAULT occurs the Powersync II will shut down (no power production) and a Fault Code will be displayed on the digital display. A list of the Fault Codes can be found in the detailed instructions for the Powersync II inverter provided in the Appendix. FAULTS will reset themselves automatically; assuming the underlying cause of the fault has been cleared, unless the inverter experiences three (3) FAULTS of any type in a one hour period. In this case a manual RESET is required on the digital display. CAUTION If a manual reset is required we highly recommend that you check the FAULT CODE list for indications that there is an equipment or wiring problem that needs addressing. One unique feature of the Powersync III inverter is its Soft Grid power limiting capability that can reduce the number of nuisance FAULTS on weak power lines during periods of high turbine power output. On a weak power line the EXCEL 15 wind turbine can, on a Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 24 windy day, raise the local utility voltage above the UL 1741 threshold, causing a FAULT. The Soft Grid feature tries to prevent these FAULTS by reducing power output from the wind turbine. When the Powersync II is in this mode the digital display will show \u201cSoft Grid\u201d.

The STOP pad on the digital display will shut down the Powersync III inverter. Press the RESET pad to restart (which will start the 300 sec. countdown). If the circuit breaker in your home or business load center (circuit breaker panel) trips, it should be reset by first switching it to the OFF position and then to the ON position. If the breaker trips again immediately, or if it continues to trip after brief periods of normal operation, switch the breaker OFF and contact your Bergey dealer for assistance. The following recommendations will help ensure the safe operation of the Powersync III inverter: 1. Keep all sources of moisture away from the Powersync III enclosure. 2. Do not work near the Powersync III with gasoline, paint thinner, or any material which produces flammable vapor. Do not store flammable materials near the Powersync III enclosure. 3. Do not open the Powersync III enclosure unless the circuit breaker and Accessible Disconnect Switch (ADC) at the base of the tower have been switched OFF. Note that even with the circuit breaker and ADC switched OFF, a shock hazard will still be present inside the Powersync III enclosure for approximately 15 minutes (as the capacitor voltage drains down). 4. Do not block airflow around the Powersync III enclosure in any way. A six- inch clearance must be maintained around the sides, top, and bottom of the enclosure for adequate air circulation. VI. TURBINE INSTALLATION Please use the following instructions in assembling and commissioning your system. If you need any additional information, please contact us. A. BWC EXCEL WIND TURBINE and TOWER Please refer to the BWC EXCEL 15 Installation Manual, and any addendum for the specific tower design, for instructions on installing the wind turbine and tower. Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 25 B. FUSED DISCONNECT SWITCH The electrical output of the wind turbine is a three-phase alternating current (AC). We strongly recommend the installation of a fused three-phase AC disconnect switch between the wind turbine and the Powersync II, as shown in the drawing on Page 26. This switch is commonly referred to as an Accessible Disconnect Switch (ADC) and most utilities will require one to be installed.

A 60A weather-tight switch box with 45A fuses for the 240 VAC, 60Hz or 220VAC, 50Hz system is recommended. The fuses will help protect the alternator in the event of a wiring, controller, or load short circuit. The fused disconnect switch is normally installed at the base of the tower. CAUTION Do not install a permanent \u201cshort circuiting switch\u201d that will provide dynamic braking of the alternator. These switches can be easily misused, leading to serious damage to the alternator. Such damage is not covered by the BWC warranty. C. WIRE RUN AND WIRE SIZES Please refer to the BWC EXCEL 15 Installation Manual for recommended wire and conduit sizes for the tower-to-Powersync III wire run. Refer to the row labeled \u201cBWC Excel 15\u201d for appropriate wire sizes. D. POWERSYNC III INVERTER The Powersync III inverter should be installed indoors, near the main breaker enclosure if possible. The Powersync III is designed to operate in a clean environment and should never be installed outdoors as it is not weatherproof and will be damaged by rain. A minimum of six inches of clearance is required on the top, bottom and sides of the Powersync III to ensure adequate air flow through the enclosure. The Powersync III should be connected to a dedicated 125A two-pole breaker installed in the main breaker box. System grounding is accomplished by attaching a wire, # 8 AWG minimum, from the grounding lug inside the Powersync III enclosure to the panel ground inside the main breaker box. Additionally, the tower \u201cbond\u201d ground wire should be connected to the grounding lug inside the Powersync III enclosure. A typical system wiring schematic for the Bergey EXCEL 15 is shown below. The three AC connections from the wind turbine can be connected to the Powersync II terminals in any order; there is no required phase orientation. DANGER Do not attempt to make the Powersync III connections with energized leads. Always have the wind turbine fully disconnected and the circuit breaker switched to \u201coff\u201d before making the Powersync III connections. Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 26 All wiring should conform to the National Electric Code or other governing local electrical code. The use of electrical conduit for wiring between components is highly recommended. All terminations should be coated with an anti-oxidation compound to prevent corrosion.

INSPECTIONS AND MAINTENANCE The Bergey EXCEL 15 turbine and tower should be inspected once 90 - 180 days after installation to ensure that no hardware was missed and there are no issues with the turbine. Following this post-installation inspection, the complete system should be inspected every four years and after any particularly severe weather. Inspections should be done on days when the wind is below 20 mph (9 m/s). Check List for Inspections 1. On guyed towers inspect each of the anchor points. Ensure that all hardware is secure and the guy wires are properly tensioned. Check to ensure that no strands are broken and the turnbuckle safety cables are in place. WARNING: Loose guy wires or unsecured turnbuckles can lead to tower failure. 2. Disconnect the inverter at the breaker panel, which will bring the turbine to a stop. Climb the tower. Always use proper safety climbing gear and safe climbing practices. DANGER Only qualified personnel with proper safety equipment should climb the tower. Never climb the tower when the rotor is turning. 3. Inspect the blades for: A. Cracks in the inner 4 ft. of each blade. This is the most highly stressed portion of the blade. B. Leading or trailing edge damage. Pay particular attention to the leading edge near the tip of each blade. C. Condition of the paint. 4. Remove the spinner and hang it from the machine. Check the marker lines on each of the blade attachment and torque plate bolts, retorquing and remarking any bolts that have loosened. Check the front bearing for seal integrity and excessive grease loss. Reattach the spinner and check that it is secure. 5. Open the cover plate on the mainframe. Inspect the slip-rings and brushes. Inspect the back-up brake circuit boards. Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 28 6. Check the rear alternator bearing for seal integrity and excessive grease loss. 7. Inspect the mainframe for cracks. 8. Check for cracks or loose hardware on the tail boom and fin. 9. Check for corrosion on the alternator. Clean and repaint as needed. 10. While descending the tower, inspect the following: A. Check that the tower wiring is properly secure. B. Check all fasteners. C. Look for any cracks in the tower structure. D. Check the condition of the guy wire attachment (guyed towers). 11. Check the connection on all ground rods and hardware. 12. Check the disconnect switch. 13.

Wind Empowerment\u2019s Maintenance Working Group (WG) was formed in Athens during the 2 nd global conference, with the following group vision: \u201cTo mutually empower people to keep their turbines running.\u201d Tripalium (French network for Piggott wind turbines: http://www.tripalium.org) produced the first two versions of a main- tenance manual that has been translated into an english version for WindEmpowerment. The 3rd version is the result of 6 months of teamwork. The objective is to increase users autonomy for producing their own electricity by being able to operate and maintain their wind turbines. This manual is available as a free download at the WE and WE members website. However donations are suitable to support a future edition of this maintenance manual. All SWT operators are invited to download and print the manual and keep it close to their turbine. Introduction Wind turbines are a fascinating way to produce electricity and increase energy autonomy. On a good site you can pro - duce most of your needs with the fruit of your endeavours. Many wind turbines inspired and based on a concept deceloped by Hugh Piggott have been manufactured all around the world. Whilst most of the turbines built according to these specifications performed well initially, many broke down after some time due to a lack of appropriate maintenance. This is a particular problem for WE-members who implement electrification projects in remote areas of developing countries, where local technical capacity to perform repairs is low and travel time to reach installation sites are particularly long. This 3 rd maintenance manual edition includes preventative and corrective maintenance according to common issues based on our experience and the WE-members feedback from around the world. It takes into account environmental factors influencing maintenance needs, a list of the tools that you need to perform the maintenance steps, more detailed maintenance procedures, troubleshooting, a check list and finally a crash page with stories of what went wrong at different SWT installation sites. Nevertheless, other events not listed can occur. For this reason this document is meant to to be updated in the future. A database will be available online to monitor SWT maintenance actions but also failures or breakdowns that occured, so we encourage you to give us your feedback at windempowerment.group@gmail.com to help us to improve future editions.This manual is mainly focused on Piggott SWT design concept with guy wired tower, for off-grid and grid-tied systems. However, it can also be useful for commercially manufactured turbines. We hope this work will help you to operate and maintain your turbine so it can reach it\u2018s full potential.

    "text": "2 Safety & precautions Unlike most of maintenance manuals for manufactured goods, we strongly encourage you to take apart your turbine. Check the weather forecast before planning a maintenance service. Before any maintenance action it is absolutely essential to: Stop the wind turbine switchin ON the short-circuit brake (figure 1). Mechanical hazards Disassembling the permanent magnet generator: The rotors have very powerful magnets, therefore it is dangerous to have metal objects or tools close to the rotors. When the two rotors are removed, they must be stored at the appropriate distance from each other, at least 1.5 m. Be careful when you dismount the blades to store them in a safe place to avoid any damage. 2 Safety & precautions Maintenance Manual 5 Fig. 1: Brake switch Electrical hazards Power cables Risk of electroshock from touching the live wires for 48V and grid-tied systems (400V), especially if you disconnect a cable and as a consequence your turbine is spinning freely. Batteries \u2022 A short circuit in the wires connected to the batteries can cause a burning or an explosion. \u2022 Charging a lead-acid battery emits hydrogen, which is highly explosive. \u2022 Make sure that the area where the battery is located is well ventilated. \u2022 Watch out for sparks, flames and other sources of ignition! Magnets If you have a pacemaker or other medical devices, stay away! The permanent magnet generators have a particularly powerful magnetic field . Safety gear We recommend you to wear safety equipment like gloves, safety shoes and a safety helmet. But remember that the best safety is to work intelligently and making sure the people around you are equally behaving in a responsible manner. Safety should be your primary concern during all maintenance actions performed on your small wind installation and particularly when raising and lowering the tower. Be attentive for risks that may arise from both electrical and mechanical components. Grundlagenrecherche"

Maintaining your wind turbine system 6.1 Blades Wooden blades Inspect the general condition of the blades. Look for cracks, holes and other damages. Take special care of the leading edge. If the leading edge is damaged you can fix it using epoxy resin. You can reinforce it using blade tape. Even though blade tape is expensive it gives very good results. If you observe severe crack in the direction of the wood fibre, you might need to replace the blade. It is very important to put a new layer of blade surface protection (linseed oil, polyurethane, etc.) each time you do a maintenance. Especially if you used linseed oil: It is better to warm the linseed oil and to apply as many layers as possible. Another less ecological but efficient option is to use varnish, polyurethane works very well and lasts quite long. Remember to sand the surface of the blade lightly with (using a rough sand paper) before applying any product. In order to facilitate the maintenance you can paint your blades with 2 different colours. Once the top paint is removed you will see the colour underneath indicating that it is time for a maintenance. Check that the balancing weights are well fixed."

Fix them with a proper product if you see any cracks. Otherwise the water can get inside and damage the whole blade. It is also recommended to clean the blades regularly (window cleaner was found to work very well for that purpose). Plywood parts If the plywood looses one or two layers (figure 26): take out the layer and apply the same product as used for the blades. Change the plywood if it is badly damaged. An option could be using a metal piece made from stainless steel or alu- minium instead of plywood. You can use larger washers or one big \u201cwasher\u201d (figure 27) for the 3.6m and 4.2m turbine diameter, especially in a gusty and turbulent instal- lation site. For the vane plywood, see \u201cFrame and tail\u201c in section in \u201c6.2 Alternator and Frame\u201c. Despite the fact that wood is a very good material for the blades, it needs some care because the tip is running at around 200 km/h. Poor quality plywood does not seem to last very long on humid, sandy or salty external conditions. Seminarhaus \u00f6kologischer Schaugarten - Witzenhausen Bearbeiter_in 22 von 46 Grundlagenrecherche Blade balancing Check the blade balancing while the turbine is spinning. If the tail vane is having quick left and right movements, your blade might need a new balancing. If there is no wind you can also check the balance of the blades with the tower lying on its trestle. Take special care with the screwing of the balancing weight. Use a sufficient number of screws (at least 2) and that are long enough (but should not touch the screws between plywood disk and triangle parts and the blades), otherwise the balancing weights might thrown off. Use stainless screws. If you forgot how to do the blade balancing, have a look into your construction manual."

They should be repacked with grease every 3 years or more frequently if necessary. Usually you will require two different sets of roller bearings: 1) The basic kit (figure 34) with the two inner cones and the two roller bearings. 2) The full kit (figure 35) with the basic kit plus the rubber sealing, the nuts, the washer, the safety pin (sometimes optional) and the cap (sometimes optional). Remember: You have to change both roller bearings at the same time. We recommend to get the full kit as it\u2018s good to have spare parts like a safety pin and it\u2018s hard to get rid of the rubber sealing without damaging it. Use quality brands like SKF or SNR if possible. Make sure that your working space and your hands are clean of dust when you replace the bearings. You can keep the shaft screwed on the nacelle during the whole operation. Take out the cap by gently knocking it out with a chisel. Depending on your hub: take off the safety pin and the nuts or strike out the nuts with a suitable drift. Be careful with the nuts as you may encounter left hand thread or right hand thread!"

Keep it straight by tapping evenly on opposite sides and take care not to scratch the seating (figure 38). If you should damage the seating you can sand it with a 400 sand paper. It can be tricky to press the new bearing shell into it\u2018s seating. The easiest thing is to use the old shell: Cut through with an angle grinder to make it less rigid (figure 39) and use it as a drift to put the new shell home. Use a hammer large enough or a hammer plus a socket to make sure that the pressure is well divided all around the shell (figure 40). You can also use a vice to keep stable the shell while knocking."

Grease the bearings thoroughly, with bearing grease but do not jam them full of grease. Start by putting the rear bearing on the shell, then assemble the rubber seal. Put it on the shaft and then fit the second bearing followed by a washer and a nut. Tighten the nut, spin the hub and then slack it off a quarter turn or so to reduce stress on the bearing. Depending on the kind of hub: - Use the safety nut and safety pin - Lock the nut by striking it on both sides with a burin (see figure 41). Add some grease in the cap and put it back gently. You can find a video animation on \u201chow to open and change the bearing\u201c on the following website: http://www.tripalium.org/blog/default/post/id/330-nouvelle-video-danimation Note: some people experienced problems with freedom in the conical bearing especially with 4.2m diameter turbines. The problems occur after few years when the rotor rubs the stator. Better to use \u201cNE\u201c bearing that that comes with 2 deep groove bearings. We use \u201cKnott\u201d vehicle bearing houses. Alternator assembly Conduct the disassembly procedure in reverse. Take lots of care while approaching the magnet rotor. Magnets must face each other. Use the index hole to find the correct position. Assemble everything and tighten well all nuts. Unscrew the jacking screws at the same time until you can pull them out freely. Apply thread lock to all stator studs and at the back of the hub. A drop of thread lock is enough. Check the gap between the rotors and the stator. The gap between a rotor and the stator should be around 2 or 3mm. Remember that the most important thing is the voltage at 60rpm (see table 6). You can adjust the gap by adding or removing nuts and washers. Check the voltage at 60rpm."

If it is not waterproof , change the junction box, but lower the tower before disconnecting the cables inside this junction box ! The cables should come in and out at the bottom of the junction box, that reduce risk that rain comes into it. Check the tightness of the terminal blocks and make sure that it has the correct tightness. This can save your turbine: We have already seen a wind turbine that was saved, hanging only by the terminal blocks (figure 42). 6 Maintaining your wind turbine system Maintenance Manual 28 Fig. 42: Fall avoid by tight terminal block Fig. 43: Reinforced tail Frame and tail Check the metal-frame for rust and cracks in the welds. Check all the other moving parts (tail hinge pipe) and if necessary, add some new grease. Check the condition of the washer inside the bearing and if neces- sary, replace it. If the washer is missing, add one. We recommend to have one welded washer and one loose for both tower and tail hinge pipes. Sometimes the tail and tower hinge pipe are wear down (less than 1mm thick - ness), usually because a thin diameter pipe has been used (2 or 3mm). So you will need to replace them by a thicker pipe (4 or 5mm) Check for cracks in the welding of the frame and tail vane (figure 44 displays a crack in the yaw pipe due to low end stop on a very turbulent site - the 3,6m turbine was only 2 years-old). If necessary, reinforce the structure (figure 43). Check the tightness of all the nuts on the tail vane."

Fig. 45: Tail brackets Seminarhaus \u00f6kologischer Schaugarten - Witzenhausen Grundlagenrecherche 6.3 Tower and foundation Tower Once the tower is down have a general look at the tower looking for rust, missing bolts, cracks in welding. Take special care at the tower yaw pipe, it\u2018s the one that are subject to the highest wear. Check all the bolts on the tower, mast base and gin pole axes, turnbuckles and shackles. Don\u2018t forget to add thread-lock while tightening. Check if the cable thimbles are in their correct position. Check if all cable clamps are well tightened. If they start to rust you can protect them with grease. Check if all shackles are secured (figure 46). Check if all turnbuckles are secure and if bolts are well tightened. Check the general condition of the guy wires. If you see some rust even severe rust (figure 47) you can protect the cables by soaking them in used motor oil. Use some fuel if the oil needs diluting. If there is broken cable strand, you need to change the cable. Remember that high quality galvanised, even more stainless, guy wires and fastenings last longer, even in harsh con - ditions. Check the general condition of the cables at the bottom of the tower. It is a wearing part that needs to be changed from time to time, depending on your installation site and on the cable quality. Untwist the electrical cable at the bottom of the tower. Make sure that the cable is free to twist at the bottom of the tower by removing the obstructing material (earth, sand, etc.). Check the waterproofing of the junction box, or plug state at the bottom of the tower. Check that the electrical terminals are not too oxidised. Get rid of the inhabitants of the junction box if there are any (see figure 48)."

If you used a chain attached to heavy anchors buried under ground, dig a little bit to check the chain state. Even high quality galvanised chain rust in the ground (figure 49). Change the chain if it is rusted. If you have big pile dig into the ground, check that the pile is not moving in direction on the tower and upward. If you have to tight the guy wires often it can be a proof of a moving pile. If the pile is moving too much, you can secure it with a second one (figure 50) and check on a regular basis how the situation evolves."

Be careful. The following recommendation are for off-grid and grid-tied systems To identify an electrical problem, check the voltage between the phases at the bottom of the tower (1 in figure 51), at the brake switch (2 in figure 51), and on the DC bus after the bridge rectifier (3 in figure 51). If the voltage between 2 phases is zero, suspect a short-circuit in the wiring or in the alternator. A pulsating torque hol- ding back the blades indicates a short between two of the 3 wires. If case of a short-circuit, an easy test is to disconnect the tower wire. If the turbine still does not start, then the short is above: in the tower cable or in the alternator. If the turbine does start, then the short is elsewhere (wiring, rectifier or controller). If no current is found, several possibilities: There may be a short-circuit failure of the alternator windings due to burned coil or insulation failures in wet conditions: In this case lower the turbine to check the stator voltage output. Electrical issues can certainly impact energy production. A blown diode in the rectifier or a bad connection in one wire will also have impact on the performance. These faults produce a growling vibration in the machine and uneven volta - ges and currents in the 3 wires."

Switch ON the wind turbine (see figure 8 on page 12). Remove the dust from all electrical components (fan, heatsink, dumpload) as it can disturb a proper cooling. Check all the connections. Tighten them if necessary. Not well tightened wires can cause a fire and increase the risk of an electrical shock. Check that all ground and metal parts (charge controller, dumpload, etc.) are connected to the same ground using a multimeter on continuity. You should have a bip or OL or small ohm value (figure 54). Check the diodes assumed your multimeter is equipped with the diode testing position (figure 55): \u2022 Good diodes: - Forward diode : 0,2 to 0,8V - Reverse bias: OL \u2022 Opened (bad) diode: OL in both way \u2022 Shorted diode: 0 to 0,4V drop in both directions. If your multimeter is not equipped with the diode testing position you can use a multimeter set to the Resistance mode (\u03a9). The forward-biased resistance of a good diode should range from 1000\u03a9 to 10M\u03a9. The reverse-biased resistance of a good diode displays OL on a multimeter. The diode is bad if values are the same in both directions."

Remedy: Use good quality guy wire or correctly sized guy wires.Chandlery correct tightness. Broken bearing (figure 59): Bearing was loose and the rubber sealing was missing: Destruction of the bearing rolls, one rotor touched the stator, damages on both rotors and stator. Remedy: Keep and/or add rubber sealing. Avoid play in the conical bearing or use NE bearing. Broken anchor (figure 60): A 22 m/s wind finished to cut a chain holding the guy wires already eroded by sand and lead to the falldown of the tower and the turbine. The pin at the tower base came off and couldn\u2018t avoid the tower fall - down. Everything was destroyed except rotors: blades, frame, tail, tower a bit deformed but re-used. Remedy: Change guy wires and chains if wear is observed; pour chain into concrete. Change the tower base, the sta- tor, the tail, the frame and replace the 3-phase cable. Broken tail hinge (figure 61): On a very turbulent site, the tail was always moving up and down leading to cracks on the hinge at the low stop level. Remedy: Reinforce the welding (see figure 43, page 28) if your turbine is installed on a very turbulent site. Burnt stator (figure 62): Wind turbine short circuited for some time. A strong windy day leads to this failure. Remedy: In case of strong wind, let your turbine run instead of braking it. Burnt Tristar batteries (figure 63): Problem with a battery that lead the burning of the Tristar which then dumped the battery pack energy directly into the dumpload. Remedy: Check your battery bank. Make sure that your charge controller capacity (e.g. if your system gives 40A, a 45A charge controller is undersized). Loss of a balancing weight (figure 64): The turbine lost one balancing weight leading to severe blade unbalancing. The owner was away for few days during a windy period. The turbine might have shake for some days before falling off the tower. Remedy: Use a greater number of screws that are long enough for the balancing weight, at least 2 per balancing weight and good quality screws (stainless). Rusted guy wire (figure 65): After 6 months old in a sandy area of the African coast with brand new (quality) guy wires Remedy: Car oil or plant oil to protect them from corrosion. Rusted rotor (figure 66): During a preventative maintenance we have seen some cracks in the resin and a little space between the resin and the steel disc. As a consequence we could quite easily remove the block of resin from the disc. Under the resin, the disc was rusted. Remedy: Paint the rotor during every maintenance. Paint or galvanise (best solution) the steel disk before putting the mag- nets. Thread rod too long (figure 67): 28m tower; 4.2m turbine. On a very windy day, the tail vane hit the blade: blade and stator broken, frame and tail badly damaged. The thread rod was too long so the balancing weight touched the thread rod, breaking the stator and damaging the frame. A problem that could have been avoided by more precise work. Remedy: We changed the design of the tail vane for the 4.2m turbine. Make sure you are checking all details especially on big turbines. The bigger they are, the more precise you have to be. Tower too tight (figure 68): This curvy tower is the result of an excessive tension in the guy wires. Remedy: Straighten the tower and slacken the guy wires."

    "text": "LIGHTNING PROTECTION SYSTEM (LPS) May 2, 2023 Lightning, Lightning Protection System, LPS, renewable energy consultant, wind energy, wind turbine, wind turbine blade repair The Lightning Protection System (LPS) is a passive lightning protection, ensuring that lightning strikes hitting the blade are transferred to the grounding. The systems are tested in accordance to the IEC 61400-24 standard. Dependent on the test tier the system is designed to handle 100-200kA, without significant system wear. Receptors The receptor is a component made from metal like copper or equivalent current transferring metal alloy. It is designed to attract lightning and transfer the load to the receptor block. The receptor has a conic screw below the base that ensures contact to the receptor block. The receptor is a replaceable component that is mounted post blade production. On older blades the tip receptor can be a massive copper piece taking up the outer 20cm of the blade tip. Risks of failure are worn receptor base or missing connection to the receptor block. The wear mechanisms include arching of the receptor base from lightning attachments and corrosion from water ingress between the receptor and receptor block. Visual inspection can be used to determine the condition of a receptor. Scorching and deformation are the most common signs of wear from lightning on the receptor base. Lightnings will also remove some material of the receptor base over time. If material removal proceeds below the blade surface, the receptor will have a reduced attractiveness to lightning. Missing sealant allows water ingress between the receptor and the receptor block, which can cause corrosion and damage to receptor block over time. Lightning Protection system receptor block To connect the receptor with the down conductor cable, an aluminum block is cast into the blade with the down-conductor during blade production. Replacement requires a complex laminate repair as the blade laminate must be removed before the block can be accessed. During post processing of the blade the receptor hole is drilled along with the thread for the conic screw. Risk of failure is detachment or missing connection to down conductor cable or receptor. Missing connection to the receptor can be deducted from damaged or missing sealant around the receptor and corrosion of the two components. Another cause for imperfect connection between the block and the receptor is if the receptor has been screwed at an angle to the block, causing only partial contact, thus reduced capacity to safely transfer lightning. A missing connection between the receptor block and down conductor cable cannot be detected by a visual inspection. Instead, it can be checked with a resistance measurement. This type of check is recommended only as investigation to locate defect in a malfunctioning system and"

Down conductor cable The design of the cable varies between the different OEM\u2019s, including copper mesh, solid copper cable, linked aluminum plates and solid cable. The cable is centered on the web of the blade, it can be located on both LE or TE side dependent on the OEM design. The cable is cast into the blade during production. Repair is possible but very complex and due to a clamping device changing shape of the cable the blade has additional risks of wrong lightning attachments post repair. If any carbon is used in the blade to increase the structural strength, it is important that the carbon is included in the LPS to avoid high difference in electric potential between the cable and the carbon laminate. If the carbon is not included, it must be thoroughly checked that it does not provide a risk of lightning jumping internally in the blade. Failure types include missing connection to root terminal, or receptor block and cable separation due to fatigue. Connection to the root terminal can be checked with an internal visual inspection, which can be performed without entering the blade. Detecting separation of the down conductor cable is possible with a dedicated internal inspection. A skilled technician or internal drone can reach 1/3 into the blade, while a sewer crawler can inspect until a few meters from the tip. The most detailed inspection is achieved by a technician or drone inspection. Root connection The root connection is designed to transfer the load from the cable to the bypass system. Blades are equipped with a slipring close to the root. The down conductor cable is connected to the slipring via a connection bolt through the blade laminate or via the backplate. Failure modes at the root terminal include missing connection to the down conductor cable. If no connection is established lightning would seek other paths to the ground, risking damage to the laminate or drivetrain, which is not designed to carry electrical current. Lightning transfer system The design of the transfer system varies between the different OEMs. It can be spring coupling, brushing, or spark gap. The brush and coupling designs are made to have as minimum partial contact from blade to grounding system at all times"

Lightning transfer system The design of the transfer system varies between the different OEMs. It can be spring coupling, brushing, or spark gap. The brush and coupling designs are made to have as minimum partial contact from blade to grounding system at all times during operation. These systems are designed to receive limited wear from lightning transfer. The spark gap will transfer the load through an arch between the slipring and the lightning rod. Thus, significant wear could be expected, leading to an occasional need of replacement. The defect mode that can be observed in the lightning transfer system is insufficient contact in the case of the brush or coupling, or too large distance in the case of the spark gap. In both ways the result would be a less effective, or completely dysfunctional LPS. Visual inspection can detect such defects, moreover for brush and coupling designs a resistance measurement can be performed, if there are doubts for the functionality of the system. Lightning Protection System measurement The currently used method of determining whether an LPS is functional is by conducting a resistance measurement. It is performed by connecting multi-meter probes to the two ends of an LPS, essentially creating a closed circuit. To check the functionality of the system within a blade, you must connect one probe to the tip receptor and one probe to the root connection. To check the functionality on turbine level, you must connect one probe to the tip receptor and one probe to the earthing system at the tower base. Performing the measurements between different components of the LPS can help localising the damaged part. For example, if no connection is established during a resistance measurement on blade level from the tip receptor on the SS to the root connection, and a 25m\u03a9 are measured from tip receptor on PS to the root connection, it can be deducted that the damaged part of the LPS is between the tip receptor on the SS and the tip receptor block. It is worth to note that for blades with spark gaps the turbine level functionality cannot be checked in the mentioned method, as there is no physical connection between the part of LPS in the blade and the one in the tower. Reporting The resistance measurement will determine if a connection between the receptor and root connection is present. A common measurement for a 40-45m blade is in the region of 25m\u03a9, and a full measurement of the grounding system should not exceed 1\u03a9. NB! For the LPS in the"

A common measurement for a 40-45m blade is in the region of 25m\u03a9, and a full measurement of the grounding system should not exceed 1\u03a9. NB! For the LPS in the blade OEMs accept between 1-10\u03a9 as part of their factory QC. NB! For the full grounding system OEMs accept up to 10-50\u03a9 as part of their commissioning check. Limitations An LPS inspection will determine if there is a connection between the receptor and the root connection. However, it is not able to determine the quality of the connection, or point to the error location, as even very limited and weak connection points due to partial separation of the LPS or cable fractures will not show from a resistance measurement. As the resistance is a measure of the system\u2019s opposition to the current and not ability to transfer current. A flaw in the system would have a very little contribution to the resistance, but a significantly reduced ability to transfer current. Therefore, even a system with a resistance measurement of 25m\u03a9, could cause a major damage during a lightning strike due to a partial connection. Recommendation Operators can reduce the risk of lightning damages with conducting regular scheduled inspections of the LPS. A maintenance strategy must be in place to define scope and inspection frequency. Receptor wear and sealant damages can be observed during a standard external inspection; down conductor connection to the root terminal can be visually inspected during a planned turbine maintenance; the integrity of the down conductor can be examined during an internal blade inspection. During an inspection it is important to: Check the surface condition of the receptor, if material wear exceeds below the blade surface, a replacement is required Check the that the connection between the down conductor, root terminal and lightning transfer system is intact. If scorching and/or arching is detected near the root terminal then it is likely that the connection is missing, or it is only partial. Check the surface condition of the transfer system. Too large spark gap or imperfect connection conditions could cause undesired lightning jumps to other parts of the turbine Large failures due to a wrong lightning attachment to the blade can be divided in two main categories. The first category is due to a \u201cforce majeure\u201d event, which is described as a lightning with unusually high current that exceeds the design limitations of the LPS. The second category is due to a defect in the LPS, which leads"

The first category is due to a \u201cforce majeure\u201d event, which is described as a lightning with unusually high current that exceeds the design limitations of the LPS. The second category is due to a defect in the LPS, which leads to a reduced ability to transfer the lightning. Or a missing connection along the system, thus reducing the likelihood of a lightning traveling through it safely all the way to the ground. The risk of the latter can be reduced by having a maintenance schedule in place for blades. This would also prevent some fatigue damages from going unnoticed. While the \u201cforce majeure\u201d damages are hard to influence, defects due to malfunctioning LPS can be minimised with a more focused effort from the industry. In the present, Germany is the only country which has meaningful legislation about the inspection of an LPS \u2013 namely it should be inspected every 4 years as a minimum. For comparison, turbine owners in Denmark are only obliged to inspect the LPS of their turbines, when they have reached 20 years in operation. Installing lightning trackers on sites can help collecting more parameters for lightning that are hitting the turbines. The wind industry will benefit from having easy access to accurate lightning data from local site when assessing damage from lightning strikes. Want to learn more?
