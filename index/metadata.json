SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The Bergey EXCEL 15 is an upwind horizontal-axis wind turbine designed for distributed generation applications, connected to the power grid on the customer\u2019s side of the utility meter. The complete unit consists of the following major components, as shown in the figure below: 1. Spinner 6. Tail Assembly 2. PowerFlex\u00ae Rotor Blades 7. Slip-Rings 3. Alternator 8. Yaw Bearing Assembly 4. Mainframe 9. Powersync\u00ae III Inverter 5. Back-up Braking 10. Auxiliary Load (not shown) Spinner PowerFlex\u00ae Rotor Blades Alternator Back-up BrakingMainframe T ail Assembly Slip-Rings Powersync\u00ae III Inverter Yaw Bearing Assembly Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 7 A. SPINNER The spinner (nose cone) is purely cosmetic. B. ROTOR SYSTEM The rotor system consists of three high-technology carbon-fiber PowerFlex\u00ae blades. Acting like aircraft wings, the blades convert the energy of the wind into rotational forces that drive the alternator. The PowerFlex\u00ae blades are rigidly attached to the alternator and they are fixed pitch. The Excel 15 rotor blades have proprietary airfoils, which were custom designed to provide high efficiency and low noise. Each blade has a serial number inscribed on its root pad at the inboard end. C. ALTERNATOR The alternator converts the rotational energy of the rotor into electricity. The alternator utilizes permanent magnets and has an inverted configuration in that the outside housing rotates, while the internal windings are stationary. It was specifically designed for the Bergey EXCEL 15 and produces power at low speeds, eliminating the need for a speed-increasing gearbox. Since it uses permanent magnets, the alternator is generating voltage whenever the rotor is turning. DANGER The output wiring of the EXCEL 15 presents a shock hazard whenever the rotor is turning. Caution must be exercised at all times to avoid electrical shock. D. MAINFRAME The mainframe is the structural backbone of the wind turbine. It serves as the attachment point for the rotor/alternator assembly, the tail assembly, the yaw bearing assembly. It also houses the yaw-axis slip-ring assembly and the controls for the back- up braking system. E. BACK-UP BRAKING The back-up braking system is an added safety system that prevents rotor overspeed in the event of a failure of the primary speed control system (inverter and dump load). Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 8 F. TAIL ASSEMBLY The tail assembly keeps the rotor aligned into the wind. G. SLIP-RING ASSEMBLY The slip-rings and brushes conduct the electricity generated in the alternator from the moving (as it orients with the direction) wind turbine to the fixed tower wiring. The slip- rings are enclosed in the steel mainframe housing to help protect them from the weather and lightning. H. YAW BEARING ASSEMBLY The yaw bearing assembly allows the turbine to freely align itself to the wind direction. I. POWERSYNC III INVERTER The Powersync III inverter converts the \u201cvariable AC\u201d from the Bergey EXCEL 15 turbine into utility grade electricity so that it can be connected to the wiring in your home or business."

YAW BEARING ASSEMBLY The yaw bearing assembly allows the turbine to freely align itself to the wind direction. I. POWERSYNC III INVERTER The Powersync III inverter converts the \u201cvariable AC\u201d from the Bergey EXCEL 15 turbine into utility grade electricity so that it can be connected to the wiring in your home or business. This conversion requires sophisticated electronics and is designed to operate automatically. The Powersync III has a digital display that provides information on the status of the system, its current output power, and its cumulative energy production. The system also includes an auxiliary load bank that absorbs excess wind energy during strong wind gusts. Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 9 IV. SYSTEM OPERATION A. NORMAL OPERATION The Bergey EXCEL 15 produces utility compatible power in the form of 240VAC, 60 Hz, single phase electricity (other voltage options are available). It is connected through the Powersync\u00ae III inverter to the utility distribution network in the same manner as household appliances or electrical machinery. When the wind speed is too low to operate the wind turbine, all of the electrical power needed for the home or business will be supplied by the utility company. During these idle periods the Powersync\u00ae III will consume approximately 0.3 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day. When the system begins producing power, the amount of power which must be purchased from the utility is reduced by an amount equal to the output of the wind system. From the perspective of the utility company the wind system output reduces the electrical load they have to supply, just as if you turned off lights and appliances. The output of the wind system fluctuates with the speed of the wind so the instantaneous amount of electricity being saved will be constantly changing. Quite often your home will be served simultaneously by the utility and your Bergey wind turbine. When the output of the wind system exceeds the power requirements of the house the excess electricity is sent back to the utility. Both the consumer\u2019s right to interconnect a wind system and the utilities obligation to purchase excess power are prescribed by federal law (PURPA, Section 210). The amount you will be credited or paid for this excess production varies state-to-state and sometimes utility-to-utility. If your utility company offers \u201cnet metering\u201d then your meter is allowed to turn backwards so that you essentially bank energy, at full value, for less windy periods. This banking can be done over a month or over a year depending on the policy of your state or your utility. If you do not get \u201cnet metering\u201d then you will have a second utility meter to register excess production and your utility will pay or credit you for this, typically at less than the rate you pay when you purchase their electricity. If your utility experiences an outage (blackout) the wind system will cease to produce power so that it does not present an electrical safety hazard to utility repair crews. During a power outage the Excel 15 turbine will come to a stop. When utility power is restored, the Powersync III will automatically return the wind system to full working status following a five minute delay and then a two minute countdown. These time delays are dictated in the UL standards required by the utilities. The rotor of the EXCEL 15 should begin to rotate when the wind speed reaches approximately 9 mph (4 m/s). Once"

When utility power is restored, the Powersync III will automatically return the wind system to full working status following a five minute delay and then a two minute countdown. These time delays are dictated in the UL standards required by the utilities. The rotor of the EXCEL 15 should begin to rotate when the wind speed reaches approximately 9 mph (4 m/s). Once started, the rotor may continue to turn in winds below 5 mph (2.2 m/s), but the system will not be producing power below this wind speed. Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 10 NOTE All operational wind speeds given assume steady winds, sea-level conditions and moderate temperatures. Hot weather, high altitude, turbulence and gusting winds will reduce system performance. NOTE The Excel 15 may exhibit poor start-up performance in light steady winds. The design of the blades is optimized for efficiency and storm protection, which necessitated some sacrifice in start-up characteristics. The rotor speed will increase with increasing wind speed and the system will produce a higher output. This output increases rapidly because the energy available in the wind varies as the third power (cube) of the wind speed. For example, if the wind speed increased form 5 mph to 10 mph, a factor of two, the energy in the wind would increase from one unit to eight units, a factor of eight (2 to the 3rd power). One result of this relationship is that there is very little energy available in light winds. For the average site, winds in the range of 12-20 mph (5.5 \u2013 9 m/s) will provide most of the system\u2019s energy production on an annual basis. The Excel 15 will operate at variable speed up to about 20 mph (9 m/s) and about 150 RPM. The speed of the rotor is controlled to limit at about 150 RPM. B. HIGH WINDS Unlike previous Bergey wind turbines, the Excel 15 does not furl (rotor turned away from the wind). The Excel 15 controls speed and protects itself from high winds by stalling the rotor progressively as wind speeds increase. In sustained high winds the rotor speed is reduced to limit power surges during strong gusts. C. PROBLEMS WITH POWER GRID If an abnormal condition occurs on the utility line, such as a voltage fluctuation or a complete interruption, the Powersync III inverter will automatically disconnect the wind turbine from the power grid and bring the rotor to a stop. D. EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN The Bergey EXCEL 15 is designed for unattended operation over an extended period of time. Exceptional situations may occur, however, in which the wind turbine should be shutdown. These situations include: 1. EXCESSIVE VIBRATION - Uneven ice build-up, ice shedding, or blade damage may cause the wind turbine to experience excessive vibration. Always shut the turbine down as soon as an increase in vibration is detected. Any new or excessive vibration in the turbine when ice is not present should be investigated immediately. 2. UNUSUAL SOUND - If the turbine begins making clinking, growling, or other unusual sound it Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 11 should be shut down and fully inspected as soon as possible. 3. INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE - Whenever someone must climb the tower the wind turbine must be shut down. Shut down of the EXCEL 15 is accomplished by operating (pressing) the red Emergency Stop button on the Powersync III inverter. To release the Emergency Stop, turn the red button clockwise until it snaps outward. This will"

Shut down of the EXCEL 15 is accomplished by operating (pressing) the red Emergency Stop button on the Powersync III inverter. To release the Emergency Stop, turn the red button clockwise until it snaps outward. This will resume automatic operation of the wind turbine. WARNING: Do not open the disconnect switch on the tower during shutdown. This would allow the turbine to restart and if the turbine tried to overspeed it would trigger the back-up braking system. E. BACK-UP BRAKING SYSTEM If the primary overspeed protection system fails, the Excel 15 has a back-up braking system located on the wind turbine. It detects an overspeed situation and applies a dynamic brake to bring the rotor to a near stop. You can tell this has occurred if the Powersync III display says \u201cWaiting for wind\u201d and there\u2019s plenty of wind [greater than 15 mph (6.7 m/s)], but the rotor does not turn. It will automatically reset if the wind drops below 2 m/s (4.5 mph). Otherwise, you can manually restart the turbine by activating and then restoring the Emergency Stop button on the Powersync III inverter. If activation of the Back-up Brake occurs repeatedly we strongly recommend that you contact your dealer or the Service Department at BWC. Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 12 V. POWERSYNC III INVERTER The Powersync III inverter is connected to the household or building electrical circuits through a dedicated circuit breaker. Before opening the Powersync III enclosure, the breaker must be turned off and the turbine Emergency Stop must be activated, to avoid electrical shock. DANGER Electric Shock Hazard. Failure to comply will result in death or serious injury. Disconnect all power to the inverter before servicing. Wait at least 5 minutes before opening the inverter door. Using the utility grid as a reference, the Powersync III inverter converts the output of the wind turbine into utility-compatible power (AC). The Powersync III inverter has been designed for automatic, unattended operation and it is programmed to provide maximum performance from your Bergey EXCEL 15 wind turbine. It is also programmed to safely disconnect the wind turbine in the event of a problem with the utility power and to automatically reconnect the turbine after the problem is remedied. The LCD digital display on the front of the Powersync III provides information on the status of your Bergey EXCEL 15 wind turbine. The contrast can be adjusted UP or DOWN using hidden buttons on the right side of the display. In normal operation the Powersync III will show the status as \u201cRunning\u201d and will display the instantaneous Output Power in Watts. Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 13 A.

Connection example As typically the tallest structure in the area, lightning damage is a concern to most inverter customers; especially those customers in areas with frequent cloud to ground lighting. BWC\u2019s warranty does not cover lightning damage to the inverter. A direct lightning strike can easily be in excess of 100kV at 100kA. Proper grounding of the turbine to the tower and running the input wires down the tower in grounded metal Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 19 conduit will take care of most of this energy. The standard inverter is capable of withstanding input line to ground surges of about 6kV at 3kA. Contact your distributor or BWC for application specific lightning surge suppression solutions. E. Inverter Operation This equipment is a UL 1741 certified1 Utility Interactive Inverter and complies with the requirements of IEEE1547 which is the standard for interconnecting distributed resources with electric power systems. It will not operate in an off-grid or backup power configuration. The normal operation of the inverter is as follows: When single phase utility power is applied to the output of the inverter, the display will power up and a message stating that the unit is initializing is shown. If there are no faults, i.e. grid voltage and frequency are in tolerance, a countdown timer set for 5 minutes (300 seconds) starts before the inverter is ready to transfer power to the utility grid. The inverter will automatically transfer power to the utility when AC voltages in the range of 30VAC to 600VAC are present at the Turbine input. As the heatsink heats up after exporting significant power for a period of time the internal cooling fans will activate.

If the ventilation is compromised or the heatsink temperature exceeds 60\u00b0C, the inverter will automatically reduce its output power. F. Touch Screen Display The touch screen display located on the front panel of the enclosure provides manual over-ride and status of the inverter\u2019s operation. The touch screen display also provides a Stop and a Reset button. The Stop button is used when it is desired to disconnect the inverter from the power grid and the wind turbine. After Stop is pressed the inverter will remain in a powered-up stand-by mode until Reset is pressed or Grid voltage is removed. When Reset is pressed the inverter will resume normal operation. The status of the inverter\u2019s operation is shown on the lines one and two of the display. The following table lists the status messages that may appear. Status Message Description Waiting Initializing The inverter has been reset or that the 5 minute countdown delay is in progress Waiting For Wind The voltage from the turbine is lower than the factory set auto- start voltage threshold AC Running The active rectifier is regulating the internal DC Boost voltage Running The inverter is transferring power to the utility grid Fault A fault has occurred.

The line to neutral voltage is important as well, although it is not reported on the LCD screen. It must be between 106 and 142Vac for both 240V and 208V units. Grid Frequency This is the frequency of the grid and determined by the utility. The frequency must be between 59.4 and 60.4 Hz for the inverter to operate. Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 21 Bus Voltage This is the voltage of the boosted DC link bus that is used to generate the output sine wave. This voltage should stay between 200 and 570 Vdc but will not trip off until it reaches 680Vdc. Auxiliary Load Current This is the current going to the auxiliary load to control the speed of the turbine. Turbine Volts This is the DC voltage of the input measured after the 3-phase AC input is rectified. The inverter will begin exporting power when this voltage exceeds 85Vdc. This voltage should never exceed 690Vdc. Vdc = Vac * 1.41 Output Power This is how much real power in Watts the inverter is currently producing or consuming if it is waiting for wind. Standby power while waiting for wind is about -10W. This measurement is not completely accurate and may not agree with an external meter. Accumulated Power This is how much real power the inverter has produced or consumed since it was last calibrated at BWC. This measurement is not completely accurate and may not agree with an external meter. VREF VREF is the input rectified voltage as a raw value. VREF = Vdc * 2.52. Vref is used as an index look-up into a virtual table used for a customizable 32 point power curve table. IREF IREF is the current request in counts for a given DC input voltage tracked by VREF. Using this configuration the inverter can be adjusted to provide any power curve required. IREF = Idc * 9 Last Fault Fault messages are displayed when a fault occurs and when the last fault parameter is selected. The following table is a list of possible faults that may be displayed.

AC OVER VOLT 2030 The AC line voltage has exceeded its maximum threshold. This occurs if OV limiting was not able to influence the high grid voltage. If this happens routinely consider increasing the output wire gage or making arrangements with the utility to upgrade their distribution transformer. AC UNDER VOLT 2280 The AC line voltage has dropped below its minimum threshold. It is normal to see this when the inverter has been disconnected from the grid. It may also occur momentarily when large equipment is turned on nearby. TURBINE PHASE 2500 Indicates that there is a problem with one or more of the turbine input phases. Bad connection, shorted or missing phase. When the inverter detects excessive ripple on the DC input, it shuts down to protect the turbine from destructive vibration. OVER CURRENT 3000 Phase A line current sensed by the converter module has exceeded its maximum current threshold. This may indicate that current is returning on the earth ground wire. OVER CURRENT 3020 Phase C line current sensed by the converter module has exceeded its maximum current threshold. This may indicate that current is returning on the earth ground wire. OVER CURRENT 3050 The DC Boost phase of the converter module has exceeded its maximum current threshold. Indicates a loss of boost control. Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 23 OVER TEMP 4000 The internal high temperature threshold has been exceeded. Check that unit has adequate ventilation, that the intake and exhaust vents are not obstructed, and that the cooling fans are operating. UNDER TEMP 4250 The internal low temperature threshold has been exceeded. Avoid exposing the unit to temperatures below -20\u00baC (-4\u00baF). GROUND FAULT 7000 An input phase appears to be shorted to chassis ground. It may require a high voltage measurement device such as a Megger to confirm the fault. AC OVER FREQ 8000 The frequency of the utility grid voltage went out of range. The upper range threshold was crossed. If supported (Unit Rev 1005 or greater) this code is also used to indicate that the ROCOF threshold was reached. ROCOF might occur when large equipment is switched on or off. AC UNDER FREQ 8100 The frequency of the utility grid voltage went out of range. The lower range threshold was crossed. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ When the Powersync III is starting up after initialization, or after the RESET button has been pushed, or after a power outage, it will go through a 300 second (5 minute) countdown that is required by UL 1741. This UL standard also dictates high and low limits for utility voltage and frequency, outside of which the inverter is required to shut down until they return to the acceptable range. This is called a FAULT condition. There are a number of possible FAULT conditions during which the Powersync III will be protecting itself or the power grid. When a FAULT occurs the Powersync II will shut down (no power production) and a Fault Code will be displayed on the digital display. A list of the Fault Codes can be found in the detailed instructions for the Powersync II inverter provided in the Appendix.

A list of the Fault Codes can be found in the detailed instructions for the Powersync II inverter provided in the Appendix. FAULTS will reset themselves automatically; assuming the underlying cause of the fault has been cleared, unless the inverter experiences three (3) FAULTS of any type in a one hour period. In this case a manual RESET is required on the digital display. CAUTION If a manual reset is required we highly recommend that you check the FAULT CODE list for indications that there is an equipment or wiring problem that needs addressing. One unique feature of the Powersync III inverter is its Soft Grid power limiting capability that can reduce the number of nuisance FAULTS on weak power lines during periods of high turbine power output. On a weak power line the EXCEL 15 wind turbine can, on a Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 24 windy day, raise the local utility voltage above the UL 1741 threshold, causing a FAULT. The Soft Grid feature tries to prevent these FAULTS by reducing power output from the wind turbine. When the Powersync II is in this mode the digital display will show \u201cSoft Grid\u201d. The STOP pad on the digital display will shut down the Powersync III inverter. Press the RESET pad to restart (which will start the 300 sec. countdown). If the circuit breaker in your home or business load center (circuit breaker panel) trips, it should be reset by first switching it to the OFF position and then to the ON position. If the breaker trips again immediately, or if it continues to trip after brief periods of normal operation, switch the breaker OFF and contact your Bergey dealer for assistance. The following recommendations will help ensure the safe operation of the Powersync III inverter: 1. Keep all sources of moisture away from the Powersync III enclosure. 2. Do not work near the Powersync III with gasoline, paint thinner, or any material which produces flammable vapor. Do not store flammable materials near the Powersync III enclosure. 3. Do not open the Powersync III enclosure unless the circuit breaker and Accessible Disconnect Switch (ADC) at the base of the tower have been switched OFF. Note that even with the circuit breaker and ADC switched OFF, a shock hazard will still be present inside the Powersync III enclosure for approximately 15 minutes (as the capacitor voltage drains down). 4. Do not block airflow around the Powersync III enclosure in any way. A six- inch clearance must be maintained around the sides, top, and bottom of the enclosure for adequate air circulation. VI. TURBINE INSTALLATION Please use the following instructions in assembling and commissioning your system. If you need any additional information, please contact us. A. BWC EXCEL WIND TURBINE and TOWER Please refer to the BWC EXCEL 15 Installation Manual, and any addendum for the specific tower design, for instructions on installing the wind turbine and tower. Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 25 B. FUSED DISCONNECT SWITCH The electrical output of the wind turbine is a three-phase alternating current (AC). We strongly recommend the installation of a fused three-phase AC disconnect switch between the wind turbine and the Powersync II, as shown in the drawing on Page 26. This switch is commonly referred to as an Accessible Disconnect Switch (ADC) and most utilities will require one to be installed. A 60A weather-tight switch box"

We strongly recommend the installation of a fused three-phase AC disconnect switch between the wind turbine and the Powersync II, as shown in the drawing on Page 26. This switch is commonly referred to as an Accessible Disconnect Switch (ADC) and most utilities will require one to be installed. A 60A weather-tight switch box with 45A fuses for the 240 VAC, 60Hz or 220VAC, 50Hz system is recommended. The fuses will help protect the alternator in the event of a wiring, controller, or load short circuit. The fused disconnect switch is normally installed at the base of the tower. CAUTION Do not install a permanent \u201cshort circuiting switch\u201d that will provide dynamic braking of the alternator. These switches can be easily misused, leading to serious damage to the alternator. Such damage is not covered by the BWC warranty. C. WIRE RUN AND WIRE SIZES Please refer to the BWC EXCEL 15 Installation Manual for recommended wire and conduit sizes for the tower-to-Powersync III wire run. Refer to the row labeled \u201cBWC Excel 15\u201d for appropriate wire sizes. D. POWERSYNC III INVERTER The Powersync III inverter should be installed indoors, near the main breaker enclosure if possible. The Powersync III is designed to operate in a clean environment and should never be installed outdoors as it is not weatherproof and will be damaged by rain. A minimum of six inches of clearance is required on the top, bottom and sides of the Powersync III to ensure adequate air flow through the enclosure. The Powersync III should be connected to a dedicated 125A two-pole breaker installed in the main breaker box. System grounding is accomplished by attaching a wire, # 8 AWG minimum, from the grounding lug inside the Powersync III enclosure to the panel ground inside the main breaker box. Additionally, the tower \u201cbond\u201d ground wire should be connected to the grounding lug inside the Powersync III enclosure. A typical system wiring schematic for the Bergey EXCEL 15 is shown below. The three AC connections from the wind turbine can be connected to the Powersync II terminals in any order; there is no required phase orientation. DANGER Do not attempt to make the Powersync III connections with energized leads. Always have the wind turbine fully disconnected and the circuit breaker switched to \u201coff\u201d before making the Powersync III connections. Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 26 All wiring should conform to the National Electric Code or other governing local electrical code. The use of electrical conduit for wiring between components is highly recommended. All terminations should be coated with an anti-oxidation compound to prevent corrosion. CAUTION All loads should be equipped with fuses or circuit breakers to avoid hazards from accidental short circuits. 10 kW Wind Turbine 24 m (80 ft) GuyedTower Safety Switch Power Processing Unit (Inverter) Cummulative Production Meter AC Load Center Owner\u2019s Manual Bergey EXCEL 15 Turbine Page 27 VII.

Founded in Senegal in 2011, WindEmpo- werment is involved in the development of locally manufactured small wind turbines for sustainable rural electrification around the world. Wind Empowerment\u2019s Maintenance Working Group (WG) was formed in Athens during the 2 nd global conference, with the following group vision: \u201cTo mutually empower people to keep their turbines running.\u201d Tripalium (French network for Piggott wind turbines: http://www.tripalium.org) produced the first two versions of a main- tenance manual that has been translated into an english version for WindEmpowerment. The 3rd version is the result of 6 months of teamwork. The objective is to increase users autonomy for producing their own electricity by being able to operate and maintain their wind turbines. This manual is available as a free download at the WE and WE members website. However donations are suitable to support a future edition of this maintenance manual. All SWT operators are invited to download and print the manual and keep it close to their turbine. Introduction Wind turbines are a fascinating way to produce electricity and increase energy autonomy. On a good site you can pro - duce most of your needs with the fruit of your endeavours. Many wind turbines inspired and based on a concept deceloped by Hugh Piggott have been manufactured all around the world. Whilst most of the turbines built according to these specifications performed well initially, many broke down after some time due to a lack of appropriate maintenance. This is a particular problem for WE-members who implement electrification projects in remote areas of developing countries, where local technical capacity to perform repairs is low and travel time to reach installation sites are particularly long. This 3 rd maintenance manual edition includes preventative and corrective maintenance according to common issues based on our experience and the WE-members feedback from around the world. It takes into account environmental factors influencing maintenance needs, a list of the tools that you need to perform the maintenance steps, more detailed maintenance procedures, troubleshooting, a check list and finally a crash page with stories of what went wrong at different SWT installation sites. Nevertheless, other events not listed can occur. For this reason this document is meant to to be updated in the future. A database will be available online to monitor SWT maintenance actions but also failures or breakdowns"

Nevertheless, other events not listed can occur. For this reason this document is meant to to be updated in the future. A database will be available online to monitor SWT maintenance actions but also failures or breakdowns that occured, so we encourage you to give us your feedback at windempowerment.group@gmail.com to help us to improve future editions.This manual is mainly focused on Piggott SWT design concept with guy wired tower, for off-grid and grid-tied systems. However, it can also be useful for commercially manufactured turbines. We hope this work will help you to operate and maintain your turbine so it can reach it\u2018s full potential. Maintenance Manual 4 Grundlagenrecherche 2 Safety & precautions Unlike most of maintenance manuals for manufactured goods, we strongly encourage you to take apart your turbine. Check the weather forecast before planning a maintenance service. Before any maintenance action it is absolutely essential to: Stop the wind turbine switchin ON the short-circuit brake (figure 1). Mechanical hazards Disassembling the permanent magnet generator: The rotors have very powerful magnets, therefore it is dangerous to have metal objects or tools close to the rotors. When the two rotors are removed, they must be stored at the appropriate distance from each other, at least 1.5 m. Be careful when you dismount the blades to store them in a safe place to avoid any damage. 2 Safety & precautions Maintenance Manual 5 Fig. 1: Brake switch Electrical hazards Power cables Risk of electroshock from touching the live wires for 48V and grid-tied systems (400V), especially if you disconnect a cable and as a consequence your turbine is spinning freely. Batteries \u2022 A short circuit in the wires connected to the batteries can cause a burning or an explosion. \u2022 Charging a lead-acid battery emits hydrogen, which is highly explosive. \u2022 Make sure that the area where the battery is located is well ventilated. \u2022 Watch out for sparks, flames and other sources of ignition! Magnets If you have a pacemaker or other medical devices, stay away! The permanent magnet generators have a particularly powerful magnetic field . Safety gear We recommend you to wear safety equipment like gloves, safety shoes and a safety helmet. But remember that the best safety is to work intelligently and making sure the people around you are equally behaving in a responsible manner. Safety should be your primary concern during all maintenance actions performed on your small wind installation and particularly when raising and lowering the tower. Be attentive for risks that may arise from both electrical and mechanical components. Grundlagenrecherche 3 Environmental factors The following table provides an overview about factors that can significantly influence the life span of a SWT. The worst enemies of SWT are: \u2022 Strong winds & turbulent wind conditions \u2022 W a t e r \u2022 Salt \u2022 Sand/erosion \u2022 Lack of maintenance 3 Environmental factors Maintenance Manual 6 Tab. 1: Environmental factors influencing the life span of a SWT Factors Risks Countermeasures Main sensitive parts Lightning Destruction of the system (turbine and electronics) In grid-tied system: Risk to burn the inverter and elec - tronics from a strike on the grid All the guy wires should be connected together with the tower to a ground rod (figure 2) or at least connected to the ground next to each anchor.

Make sure the electric cable will not be pinched during the process. 5 Lowering and raising the turbine 5 Lowering and raising the turbine Usually the tower of a Piggott wind turbine is made of pipes assembled and kept in vertical position with guy wires. Turbine lowering and raising operations are done with a gin pole and a grip hoist. It can be dangerous don\u2018t take unne- cessary risks. The main risk is the tower falling down with the turbine . In worst case, a person can be seriously injured. This can happen in case of: \u2022 One or several guy wires break on the same side. \u2022 A grip hoist cable breaks or the cable is released abnormaly (problem with the break lever of the grip hoist) \u2022 Strong wind To prevent these risks, follow the precaution safety operations. A team of at least 2 experienced people is required but 4 people make the work a lot easier. Maintenance Manual 12 Fig. 8: Brake switch For the electrical inspection it is important that your turbine is operating. Therefore go to section 6.4 to see the steps that need to be done before lowering the turbine. Grundlagenrecherche Installing the pulling grip hoist Note: it\u2018s assumed that the gin pole is already fastened to the tower. If this is not the case, you will need to install the gin pole between the foot of the tower and the lift anchor. Start by attaching the grip hoist to the head of the gin pole and the lift anchor. One by one (or together if they are attached at the same part), detach the guy wires from the lift anchor to the head of the gin pole. The tower should always be attached to prevent it falling over. 5 Lowering and raising the turbine Fig. 9: Working area and safety zone Maintenance Manual 13 Fig. 10: Wire pulling grip hoist Brake Release Lever Pulling Lever Fig. 11: Extremity of the gin pole with the grip hoist Insert the full wire from the extremity without hook into the hole, going out from the pin side.

When you can reach the turbine, 2 people take the tail carefully and orientate it so that the blades are facing up - wards and avoid to turn over. Place the tail in furling position and lean it against a support like a wooden palette to keep the turbine stable. In case of a problem you can stop activating the grip hoist and even raise back the tower back at any time if necessary changing the arm onto the pulling lever).

Check that all guy wires and all fastenings like cable clamps, turnbuckles and shackles are well tightened and secured. Secure the turnbuckles with a guy wire or a piece of an iron wire (see figure 13). Finally unleash the turbine (switch OFF the brake).

Maintaining your wind turbine system 6.1 Blades Wooden blades Inspect the general condition of the blades. Look for cracks, holes and other damages. Take special care of the leading edge. If the leading edge is damaged you can fix it using epoxy resin. You can reinforce it using blade tape. Even though blade tape is expensive it gives very good results. If you observe severe crack in the direction of the wood fibre, you might need to replace the blade. It is very important to put a new layer of blade surface protection (linseed oil, polyurethane, etc.) each time you do a maintenance. Especially if you used linseed oil: It is better to warm the linseed oil and to apply as many layers as possible. Another less ecological but efficient option is to use varnish, polyurethane works very well and lasts quite long. Remember to sand the surface of the blade lightly with (using a rough sand paper) before applying any product. In order to facilitate the maintenance you can paint your blades with 2 different colours. Once the top paint is removed you will see the colour underneath indicating that it is time for a maintenance. Check that the balancing weights are well fixed. 6 Maintaining your wind turbine system Maintenance Manual 21 Fig. 26: Damaged plywood Fig. 27: Big washer Fibreglass blades Inspect for cracks within the resin of the surface.

Fix them with a proper product if you see any cracks. Otherwise the water can get inside and damage the whole blade. It is also recommended to clean the blades regularly (window cleaner was found to work very well for that purpose). Plywood parts If the plywood looses one or two layers (figure 26): take out the layer and apply the same product as used for the blades. Change the plywood if it is badly damaged. An option could be using a metal piece made from stainless steel or alu- minium instead of plywood. You can use larger washers or one big \u201cwasher\u201d (figure 27) for the 3.6m and 4.2m turbine diameter, especially in a gusty and turbulent instal- lation site. For the vane plywood, see \u201cFrame and tail\u201c in section in \u201c6.2 Alternator and Frame\u201c. Despite the fact that wood is a very good material for the blades, it needs some care because the tip is running at around 200 km/h. Poor quality plywood does not seem to last very long on humid, sandy or salty external conditions. Seminarhaus \u00f6kologischer Schaugarten - Witzenhausen Bearbeiter_in 22 von 46 Grundlagenrecherche Blade balancing Check the blade balancing while the turbine is spinning. If the tail vane is having quick left and right movements, your blade might need a new balancing. If there is no wind you can also check the balance of the blades with the tower lying on its trestle. Take special care with the screwing of the balancing weight. Use a sufficient number of screws (at least 2) and that are long enough (but should not touch the screws between plywood disk and triangle parts and the blades), otherwise the balancing weights might thrown off. Use stainless screws. If you forgot how to do the blade balancing, have a look into your construction manual. 6 Maintaining your wind turbine system Maintenance Manual 22 Seminarhaus \u00f6kologischer Schaugarten - Witzenhausen Grundlagenrecherche 6.2 Alternator and frame Alternator disassembly This action should be performed if you encounter one of these 2 problems: a) Failure of the bearings or b) Friction between rotor and stator. It should also be done every 3 years. You will need the 3 jacking screws for this operation. Never put your fingers between the rotor disks, as they can be pinched! 6 Maintaining your wind turbine system Fig. 28: Alternator disassembly Fig. 29: Index threaded rod and hole Maintenance Manual 23 The overall procedure operation is to take off the front rotor, then the stator and finally the back rotor but before proces- sing find the index hole (figure 29) or the mark on the stud which indicates alignment for reassembling.

When you have reached 10cm, the magnet field is weak enough for you to pull the rotor away. Store it in clean, dry place, away from metal components. Take away the stator. Remember the stator position (it should be the cable at the bottom). The rotors should be at equal distance all the time. Seminarhaus \u00f6kologischer Schaugarten - Witzenhausen Grundlagenrecherche If you detect significant play in the hub, open everything to check and clean or change the roller bearing (see the pro - cedure next page). If the hub shaft is not welded, unscrew the nuts behind the bearing hub rotor of each stud and remove all the studs from the back rotor. Remove the back rotor carefully and put it in a safe place, far from the other rotor. Check the stator and rotor for cracks in the resin structure, for friction and for wires with missing enamel. You will need to change magnets if they are corroded (figure 32). Cut the resin and replace the corroded one with a new magnet. Refill the replaced material with new resin and repaint the whole rotor. Sometimes resin cracks occur at the edge of the rotor (figure 33). Take away the old resin that comes up and replace by a new one. Repaint the whole rotor. If any of the copper wires is without enamel, you should apply some resin or a bit of glue (like epoxy adhesive). You also need to find the cause of the problem and fix it (see Troubleshooting on page 40). Check that you have the same resistance value between the phases by using a multimeter. Check the 3-phase cable that comes out of the resin. 6 Maintaining your wind turbine system Maintenance Manual 24 Fig. 30: Front rotor with the 3 jacking screws Fig. 31: Friction on the stator Fig. 32: Damaged rotor Fig. 33: Cracks in resin in the rotor edge Fig. 34: Stator that needs to be changed Seminarhaus \u00f6kologischer Schaugarten - Witzenhausen Grundlagenrecherche Replacing the roller bearings Bearings need to be replaced if the rotor rubs against the stator or when the turbine no longer turns. They should be repacked with grease every 3 years or more frequently if necessary. Usually you will require two different sets of roller bearings: 1) The basic kit (figure 34) with the two inner cones and the two roller bearings. 2) The full kit (figure 35) with the basic kit plus the rubber sealing, the nuts, the washer, the safety pin (sometimes optional) and the cap (sometimes optional). Remember: You have to change both roller bearings at the same time. We recommend to get the full kit as it\u2018s good to have spare parts like a safety pin and it\u2018s hard to get rid of the rubber sealing without damaging it. Use quality brands like SKF or SNR if possible. Make sure that your working space and your hands are clean of dust when you replace the bearings. You can keep the shaft screwed on the nacelle during the whole operation. Take out the cap by gently knocking it out with a chisel. Depending on your hub: take off the safety pin and the nuts or strike out the nuts with a suitable drift. Be careful with the nuts"

If you do it gently you may be able to re-use the rubber seal. Take out the outer shell by knocking it gently with a suitable drift. Keep it straight by tapping evenly on opposite sides and take care not to scratch the seating (figure 38). If you should damage the seating you can sand it with a 400 sand paper. It can be tricky to press the new bearing shell into it\u2018s seating. The easiest thing is to use the old shell: Cut through with an angle grinder to make it less rigid (figure 39) and use it as a drift to put the new shell home. Use a hammer large enough or a hammer plus a socket to make sure that the pressure is well divided all around the shell (figure 40). You can also use a vice to keep stable the shell while knocking. 6 Maintaining your wind turbine system Maintenance Manual 26 Fig. 37: Remove the seal Fig. 38: Take out the outer shell Fig. 40: Put the new shell home Fig. 39: Cut the shell with an angle grinder Fig. 41: Lock the nut Seminarhaus \u00f6kologischer Schaugarten - Witzenhausen Grundlagenrecherche Don\u2018t mix up the sense of the shell! Grease the bearings thoroughly, with bearing grease but do not jam them full of grease. Start by putting the rear bearing on the shell, then assemble the rubber seal. Put it on the shaft and then fit the second bearing followed by a washer and a nut. Tighten the nut, spin the hub and then slack it off a quarter turn or so to reduce stress on the bearing. Depending on the kind of hub: - Use the safety nut and safety pin - Lock the nut by striking it on both sides with a burin (see figure 41). Add some grease in the cap and put it back gently. You can find a video animation on \u201chow to open and change the bearing\u201c on the following website: http://www.tripalium.org/blog/default/post/id/330-nouvelle-video-danimation Note: some people experienced problems with freedom in the conical bearing especially with 4.2m diameter turbines. The problems occur after few years when the rotor rubs the stator. Better to use \u201cNE\u201c bearing that that comes with 2 deep groove bearings. We use \u201cKnott\u201d vehicle bearing houses.

If it is not waterproof , change the junction box, but lower the tower before disconnecting the cables inside this junction box ! The cables should come in and out at the bottom of the junction box, that reduce risk that rain comes into it. Check the tightness of the terminal blocks and make sure that it has the correct tightness. This can save your turbine: We have already seen a wind turbine that was saved, hanging only by the terminal blocks (figure 42). 6 Maintaining your wind turbine system Maintenance Manual 28 Fig. 42: Fall avoid by tight terminal block Fig. 43: Reinforced tail Frame and tail Check the metal-frame for rust and cracks in the welds. Check all the other moving parts (tail hinge pipe) and if necessary, add some new grease. Check the condition of the washer inside the bearing and if neces- sary, replace it. If the washer is missing, add one. We recommend to have one welded washer and one loose for both tower and tail hinge pipes. Sometimes the tail and tower hinge pipe are wear down (less than 1mm thick - ness), usually because a thin diameter pipe has been used (2 or 3mm). So you will need to replace them by a thicker pipe (4 or 5mm) Check for cracks in the welding of the frame and tail vane (figure 44 displays a crack in the yaw pipe due to low end stop on a very turbulent site - the 3,6m turbine was only 2 years-old). If necessary, reinforce the structure (figure 43). Check the tightness of all the nuts on the tail vane. Fig. 44: Crack in the tail pipe Note: An unexpected low production can be due to a light tail vane. You can check the surface and thickness of the plywood wind vane and add some weight on the tail vane. If you notice wooden tail cracks at the end of the brackets, you can extend the tail boom to the middle or end of the tail plywood and change the 2 diagonal brackets by 2 vertical ones (figure 45).

Don\u2018t forget to add thread-lock while tightening. Check if the cable thimbles are in their correct position. Check if all cable clamps are well tightened. If they start to rust you can protect them with grease. Check if all shackles are secured (figure 46). Check if all turnbuckles are secure and if bolts are well tightened. Check the general condition of the guy wires. If you see some rust even severe rust (figure 47) you can protect the cables by soaking them in used motor oil. Use some fuel if the oil needs diluting. If there is broken cable strand, you need to change the cable. Remember that high quality galvanised, even more stainless, guy wires and fastenings last longer, even in harsh con - ditions. Check the general condition of the cables at the bottom of the tower. It is a wearing part that needs to be changed from time to time, depending on your installation site and on the cable quality. Untwist the electrical cable at the bottom of the tower. Make sure that the cable is free to twist at the bottom of the tower by removing the obstructing material (earth, sand, etc.). Check the waterproofing of the junction box, or plug state at the bottom of the tower. Check that the electrical terminals are not too oxidised. Get rid of the inhabitants of the junction box if there are any (see figure 48). 6 Maintaining your wind turbine system Fig. 48: Inhabitants in a junction box Fig. 47: Rusty guy wire Fig. 46: Secured shackle Maintenance Manual 29 Seminarhaus \u00f6kologischer Schaugarten - Witzenhausen Grundlagenrecherche Foundation In case you have concrete foundations: - check for cracks in the concrete, - check the state of the rebar/chain that comes out of the concrete as it is exposed to weather and wear, - clean the base of the tower, especially if it is sandy. If you used a chain attached to heavy anchors buried under ground, dig a little bit to check the chain state. Even high quality galvanised chain rust in the ground (figure 49). Change the chain if it is rusted. If you have big pile dig into the ground, check that the pile is not moving in direction on the tower and upward. If you have to tight the guy wires often it can be a proof of a moving pile. If the pile is moving too much, you can secure it with a second one (figure 50) and check on a regular basis how the situation evolves. 6 Maintaining your wind turbine system Fig. 50: Secured anchorFig. 49: Weak chain Maintenance Manual 30 Seminarhaus \u00f6kologischer Schaugarten - Witzenhausen Grundlagenrecherche 6.4 Electrical system Inspection when the turbine is running There is a risk of high voltage and high current during this testing procedure.

Be careful. The following recommendation are for off-grid and grid-tied systems To identify an electrical problem, check the voltage between the phases at the bottom of the tower (1 in figure 51), at the brake switch (2 in figure 51), and on the DC bus after the bridge rectifier (3 in figure 51). If the voltage between 2 phases is zero, suspect a short-circuit in the wiring or in the alternator. A pulsating torque hol- ding back the blades indicates a short between two of the 3 wires. If case of a short-circuit, an easy test is to disconnect the tower wire. If the turbine still does not start, then the short is above: in the tower cable or in the alternator. If the turbine does start, then the short is elsewhere (wiring, rectifier or controller). If no current is found, several possibilities: There may be a short-circuit failure of the alternator windings due to burned coil or insulation failures in wet conditions: In this case lower the turbine to check the stator voltage output. Electrical issues can certainly impact energy production. A blown diode in the rectifier or a bad connection in one wire will also have impact on the performance. These faults produce a growling vibration in the machine and uneven volta - ges and currents in the 3 wires. 6 Maintaining your wind turbine system Maintenance Manual 31 Fig. 51: Electrical scheme Seminarhaus \u00f6kologischer Schaugarten - Witzenhausen Grundlagenrecherche \u2022 Off-grid Explanation of figure 52: Check the AC-voltage between each phase, it should be the same between each phases (1). Check that the bridge rectifier is working properly by measuring the DC-voltage in (2). Also check the DC-voltage in different points of the circuit: Batteries (3), charge controller (4), inverter (5). It should be the same value. Check the AC-voltage output on the inverter (6). If you have a clamp meter check if there is current going into the batteries (7) and/or into the dump-load (8). If your system has a meter, check if the values are in the same range. If you see some significant difference you might need to reset your meter (see procedure in your meter manual). Check if the LEDs or the screen are working on the charge controller. Stalling can occur if the battery voltage falls to below half of its nominal value due to heavy battery discharge or because of a failure. The turbine will be loaded with current at low speed and the blades will stall, preventing the turbine from reaching operating speed. 6 Maintaining your wind turbine system Maintenance Manual 32 Fig. 52: Off-grid electrical panel Seminarhaus \u00f6kologischer Schaugarten - Witzenhausen Bearbeiter_in 33 von 46 Grundlagenrecherche \u2022 Grid-tied Explanation of figure 53: Check the 3-phase voltage input from the wind turbine (1).

Switch ON the wind turbine (see figure 8 on page 12). Remove the dust from all electrical components (fan, heatsink, dumpload) as it can disturb a proper cooling. Check all the connections. Tighten them if necessary. Not well tightened wires can cause a fire and increase the risk of an electrical shock. Check that all ground and metal parts (charge controller, dumpload, etc.) are connected to the same ground using a multimeter on continuity. You should have a bip or OL or small ohm value (figure 54). Check the diodes assumed your multimeter is equipped with the diode testing position (figure 55): \u2022 Good diodes: - Forward diode : 0,2 to 0,8V - Reverse bias: OL \u2022 Opened (bad) diode: OL in both way \u2022 Shorted diode: 0 to 0,4V drop in both directions. If your multimeter is not equipped with the diode testing position you can use a multimeter set to the Resistance mode (\u03a9). The forward-biased resistance of a good diode should range from 1000\u03a9 to 10M\u03a9. The reverse-biased resistance of a good diode displays OL on a multimeter. The diode is bad if values are the same in both directions. 6 Maintaining your wind turbine system Maintenance Manual 34 Fig. 54: Multimeter on continuity position Fig. 55: Diode testing Seminarhaus \u00f6kologischer Schaugarten - Witzenhausen Bearbeiter_in 35 von 46 Grundlagenrecherche \u2022 Off-grid Check the battery bank voltage and the voltage of each single battery. For flood lead acid batteries: Check the level of distilled water by opening the cap. The lead plate should be flooded entirely. Add distilled water if necessary. Check the battery bank connectors. Oxidised ones should be cleaned with sand paper and be protected with some grease (figure 56). Check the fuses with your multimeter on continuity position (see figure 54). Check the surrounding area of the dumpload and look for signs of overheating or burning. Make also sure the tempe - rature in this area is neither too high nor too low.

Grundlagenrecherche 8.1 Wind turbine Inspect the blades for: \u2022 Cracks noticeable in the wood or in the fiberglass (for resin blade), especially at the blade roots \u2022 Leading or trailing edge damage \u2022 Condition of the paint (if painted) or coating \u2022 Check if balancing weights are still fixed Check the rotor and stator for scratches and failures in resin Inspect the metal frame for cracks and rust on the welding Inspect the condition of the electrical cable and the gripping system Check for cracks or loose equipment on the tail-boom and vane Check the tightness on the blade nuts Check the front bearing for seal integrity and grease loss. Check the thightness of the flange Check the play in the hub Check the connections in the junction box and the junction box condition Check the tail pivot system, it should move freely and have enough grease Release the turbine switching the brake OFF and check that the generator turns freely Measure the resistance between each phase 8 Check list Maintenance Manual 38 Grundlagenrecherche Maintenance Manual 39 8.2 Tower and guy wires Check if the electrical cable is twisted and check the condition of the cable. Check the tower weldings. Check the tightness of the cable clamps. Make sure that the tower shackles are secure and/or well tightened. Check the tightness of the fasteners (tower and base). Check the connection at all ground rods, at the tower and guy wires. Check the connections in the junction box and the condition of the junction box. 8.3 Electrical system Make a visual inspection for evidence of heat. Check if there are rusted parts (screws, crimp lugs, etc.). Remove the dust from all electrical components. Check the tightening of the electrical connections Check the bridge rectifier Check all the ground connections Only relevant for off-grid systems: Check the general state of the batteries and the water level, refill distilled water if necessary. Check the tightening of the electrical connections. Only relevant for grid-tied systems: Check the production on the inverter and see if the values are relevant: \u2022 Is electricity generation linked to the estimated wind conditions at the installation site? \u2022 Is the data well recorded? 8 Check list Grundlagenrecherche The following table is a non-exhaustive enumeration of damages and problems that might occur: Tab. 8: Troubleshooting Observation Diagnosis / causes Problem Remedies Blades are not spinning Hub bearing is stuck Lack of grease Add some grease inside the bearing Water ingress in hub bearing Replace the corroded parts and the bearing seal Nut too tight Loosen the nut Roller bearing out of order Change the roller bearing Ice in generator Wait for warm weather Ice on blade Wait for warmer temperatures/ make the surface blade smoother Batteries below their voltage value Charge the batteries, you may have to change them The brake switch is ON Switch the brake OFF Blades are spinning slowly in strong wind Stator and rotor are touching (scraping or rubbing sound at low rpm) Increase spacing between stator/rotor (use Loctite 243 on threads afterwards) Magnet swelling due to cor- rosion Change the affected magnet Damaged roller bearing Change the roller bearing Unscrewed or missing nuts on the stator studs Tighten them with threadlock Debris between rotor and stator Turn propeller gently by hand and blow, use piece of plastic or some tape to dislodge debris Short circuit Power cable is pinched at the top or bottom of the tower Clear the top/bottom of the tower Burnt out stator Build a new"

Remedy: Use good quality guy wire or correctly sized guy wires.Chandlery correct tightness. Broken bearing (figure 59): Bearing was loose and the rubber sealing was missing: Destruction of the bearing rolls, one rotor touched the stator, damages on both rotors and stator. Remedy: Keep and/or add rubber sealing. Avoid play in the conical bearing or use NE bearing. Broken anchor (figure 60): A 22 m/s wind finished to cut a chain holding the guy wires already eroded by sand and lead to the falldown of the tower and the turbine. The pin at the tower base came off and couldn\u2018t avoid the tower fall - down. Everything was destroyed except rotors: blades, frame, tail, tower a bit deformed but re-used. Remedy: Change guy wires and chains if wear is observed; pour chain into concrete. Change the tower base, the sta- tor, the tail, the frame and replace the 3-phase cable. Broken tail hinge (figure 61): On a very turbulent site, the tail was always moving up and down leading to cracks on the hinge at the low stop level. Remedy: Reinforce the welding (see figure 43, page 28) if your turbine is installed on a very turbulent site. Burnt stator"

Broken tail hinge (figure 61): On a very turbulent site, the tail was always moving up and down leading to cracks on the hinge at the low stop level. Remedy: Reinforce the welding (see figure 43, page 28) if your turbine is installed on a very turbulent site. Burnt stator (figure 62): Wind turbine short circuited for some time. A strong windy day leads to this failure. Remedy: In case of strong wind, let your turbine run instead of braking it. Burnt Tristar batteries (figure 63): Problem with a battery that lead the burning of the Tristar which then dumped the battery pack energy directly into the dumpload. Remedy: Check your battery bank. Make sure that your charge controller capacity (e.g. if your system gives 40A, a 45A charge controller is undersized). Loss of a balancing weight (figure 64): The turbine lost one balancing weight leading to severe blade unbalancing. The owner was away for few days during a windy period. The turbine might have shake for some days before falling off the tower. Remedy: Use a greater number of screws that are long enough for the balancing weight, at least 2 per balancing weight and good quality screws (stainless). Rusted guy wire (figure 65): After 6 months old in a sandy area of the African coast with brand new (quality) guy wires Remedy: Car oil or plant oil to protect them from corrosion. Rusted rotor (figure 66): During a preventative maintenance we have seen some cracks in the resin and a little space between the resin and the steel disc. As a consequence we could quite easily remove the block of resin from the disc. Under the resin, the disc was rusted. Remedy: Paint the rotor during every maintenance. Paint or galvanise (best solution) the steel disk before putting the mag- nets. Thread rod too long (figure 67): 28m tower; 4.2m turbine. On a very windy day, the tail vane hit the blade: blade and stator broken, frame and tail badly damaged. The thread rod was too long so the balancing weight touched the thread rod, breaking the stator and damaging the frame. A problem that could have been avoided by more precise work. Remedy: We changed the design of the tail vane for the 4.2m turbine. Make sure you are checking all details especially on big turbines. The bigger they are, the more precise you have to be. Tower too tight (figure 68): This curvy tower is the result of an excessive tension in the guy wires. Remedy: Straighten the tower and slacken the guy wires."
