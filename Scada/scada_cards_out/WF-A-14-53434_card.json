  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window ambient wind was very low on average (~1.64 m/s) with a sharp peak to 17.2 m/s; mean power was essentially zero with very low variability while blade pitch stayed high (~24\u00b0) and temperature averaged ~35\u00b0C. Operationally, generator speed showed large variability despite minimal rotor speed fluctuation, there was a substantial alignment offset averaging ~67.6\u00b0, and power residuals averaged modestly positive (~0.115), with no abnormal status events recorded."
