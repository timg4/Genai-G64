  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window the site saw very low average inflow (\u22481.6 m/s) with a single short gust up to 17.2 m/s; electrical output remained essentially zero with only tiny fluctuations. Drive-side rotational speed showed large variability while blade pitch remained persistently high, and there was a sustained, large orientation offset between the rotor and the inflow; a small positive power residual and a moderate operating temperature (~35\u00b0C) were also present, with no abnormal status events logged."
