  "summary": "Over the 6-hour window winds were mostly light (mean \u2248 2.83 m/s, std \u2248 0.76 m/s) with a brief gust to 11 m/s; power output remained essentially zero (mean \u2248 -0.0012, very low variability) while generator speed showed moderate variability despite a perfectly steady rotor speed. Blade pitch stayed near full feather (~89.4\u00b0) and the nacelle was substantially misaligned from the wind (~71.6\u00b0), with a small positive power residual and average component temperature around 62\u00b0C; all timestamps in this period reported a persistent non-standard operational state."
