  "summary": "Over this 6\u2011hour window the turbine remained in **Downtime** for all **37** ten\u2011minute intervals, with **near\u2011zero average power** (power_mean \u2248 \u20110.0012, very low variability) despite generally low winds on average (wind_speed_mean \u2248 2.83, but with a brief spike up to 11.0). Operational signals were largely static, including **zero rotor speed variability** (rotor_rpm_std = 0) and **high mean pitch** (~89.4), while **yaw misalignment** stayed high on average (~71.6) and generator speed showed some variation (generator_rpm_std \u2248 4.89). The **power residual** was modestly positive on average (~0.0126) and temperatures averaged ~62.4."
