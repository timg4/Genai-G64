  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window wind speeds were low on average (~2.8 m/s) with an isolated peak to 11 m/s, yet mean electrical output stayed essentially zero with very little variability. One rotational stage showed no variation while the downstream stage did vary, and control surfaces were held near their high-angle position; there was also a large mean alignment offset (~71.6\u00b0) and the system reported a non-normal status for the entire period. Temperature averaged ~62.4 and the power residuals remained small (~0.0126)."
