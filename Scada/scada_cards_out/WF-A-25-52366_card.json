  "summary": "Over the six-hour window wind conditions were strong and steady (mean ~18.0 m/s, std ~1.0 m/s) with a short peak to 33.9 m/s, while electrical power remained extremely stable (mean ~0.9755, std ~0.0002) and status indicators stayed normal. Operational patterns show essentially zero rotor-speed variability, modest generator-speed variability, an average pitch around 14.8\u00b0, a persistent yaw offset near 8.1\u00b0, and a small negative mean power residual (~-0.107), indicating slight systematic underperformance versus the reference."
