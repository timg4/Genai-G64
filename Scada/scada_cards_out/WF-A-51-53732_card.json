  "summary": "Winds averaged about 15.7 m/s with low variability (std 0.72 m/s) but included a peak gust to 36.8 m/s. Electrical power remained nearly constant (mean ~0.976, std ~0.0002) yet averaged ~0.11 below expected; rotor speed showed no variability while generator speed varied minimally, with blade pitch around 10.65\u00b0 and yaw misalignment about 1.58\u00b0. Operational status was non-normal for the entire window and temperatures were elevated (mean ~67\u00b0C)."
