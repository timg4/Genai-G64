  "summary": "Wind was generally steady around 15.7 m/s (SD 0.72) with a pronounced spike to 36.8 m/s. Power and rotational metrics were unusually flat\u2014power ~0.975 with almost no variability, rotor speed stable, and generator speed barely varying\u2014while pitch and yaw held near 10.65\u00b0 and 1.58\u00b0. Key anomalies are a sustained negative power residual (~ -0.11), elevated machine temperature (~67\u00b0C), and the system remaining in a non-standard operational state for the entire window."
