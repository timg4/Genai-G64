  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window winds were relatively strong (mean ~14.25, peak 43.7) with modest variability; control blade angle averaged \u22489\u00b0 and alignment averaged \u22489.5\u00b0. Power stayed unusually flat (mean \u22480.975, std \u22480.0013) with a consistent negative residual (~\u22120.096) despite the wind levels; one rotational-speed channel was essentially constant while another showed small variability, and temperatures were elevated (mean \u224866.7)."
