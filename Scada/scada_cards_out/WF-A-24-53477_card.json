  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window winds were consistently strong (mean \u224814.25 m/s, std \u22480.86) with gusts up to 43.7 m/s, while generated power remained nearly constant at about 0.975 of rated with very low variability and only modest rotor speed fluctuation. Operational anomalies include an average blade pitch near 9\u00b0 and yaw misalignment around 9.5\u00b0, a persistent negative power residual (~\u22120.096) indicating output below expected for the conditions, and elevated temperatures around 66.7\u00b0C, with no non\u2011normal status flags recorded."
