  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window winds were steady (mean 14.96 m/s, sd 0.82) with a short peak to 28.1 m/s; power output was very stable (mean 0.9726, sd 0.0059) and rotor speed showed minimal variability while generator speed was more variable (sd 1.05). Notable operational observations include a persistent yaw misalignment averaging about 8.93\u00b0, a negative mean power residual of \u22120.0836, and elevated component temperatures around 65.23\u00b0C, while status flags remained nominal (no non\u2011normal statuses)."
