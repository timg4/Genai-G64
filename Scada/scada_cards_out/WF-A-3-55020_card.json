  "summary": "Over the 6-hour window winds were consistently strong (mean ~15.0 m/s, std ~0.82) with a short peak to 28.1 m/s; power output was very steady (mean ~0.973, std ~0.0059) and rotor speed showed minimal variability while generator speed was comparatively more variable. Persistent operational characteristics include a mean pitch around 9.5\u00b0 and a yaw misalignment near 9\u00b0, a slightly negative power residual (~-0.084) indicating marginally lower-than-expected output, elevated temperatures (~65.2\u00b0C), and no non-normal status flags."
