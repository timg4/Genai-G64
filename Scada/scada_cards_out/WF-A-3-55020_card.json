  "summary": "Across the 6\u2011hour window the turbine stayed in Normal Operation for all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals, producing near-rated power (mean 0.9726) with very low variability (power_std 0.0059) under generally strong winds (wind_speed_mean 14.96, std 0.82), with at least one brief extreme wind event (wind_speed_max 28.1; high_wind tag). Operational variability was low overall (rotor_rpm_std 0.0315; generator_rpm_std 1.0482) with steady average pitch (9.53) and a persistent nonzero yaw misalignment (mean 8.93). Notable anomalies/patterns include a consistently negative power residual (mean \u22120.0836) and elevated temperatures (temp_mean 65.23; elevated_temps tag)."
