  "summary": "Over the six-hour window, wind conditions were generally moderate (mean ~5.6 m/s, low variability) but included a sharp gust up to 36.9 m/s; mean power output was low (~0.13) with modest scatter and a slight negative residual (~-0.09) relative to expectation. Rotational behavior shows a very steady rotor speed (std ~0.5) while the generator speed exhibited substantial variability (std ~55.9). Control and environment metrics were stable on average (pitch around -1.44, yaw misalignment about 11.9, temperature ~48.2) and the system remained in normal operating status throughout."
