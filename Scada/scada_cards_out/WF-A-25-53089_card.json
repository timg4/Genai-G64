  "summary": "Wind conditions were mostly steady around 5.6 m/s (std 0.64) with a brief extreme spike to 36.9 m/s; mean power was low (~0.134) with modest variability (std 0.051) and a negative average residual (~-0.089), indicating output tended to sit below expected. Rotor speed variability was minimal (~0.50), while generator-speed variability was high (~55.9); pitch averaged about -1.44\u00b0, yaw misalignment stayed elevated (~11.9\u00b0), temperature averaged ~48\u00b0C, and no non-normal operational states were recorded."
