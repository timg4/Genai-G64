  "summary": "Over the six-hour window winds averaged about 12.7 m/s with low variability but included a high gust to 30.2 m/s, while power output was very steady around 0.95 p.u. with only minor fluctuations. A small persistent positive power residual (~0.125 p.u.) was present, and one rotational-speed signal showed no variability while another showed modest variation, which is inconsistent with the otherwise stable trends. Temperatures were elevated (\u224874) and average yaw misalignment (~2.5\u00b0) with pitch near 3.5\u00b0 were observed, and no non-normal operating statuses were recorded."
