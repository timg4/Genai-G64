  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window winds averaged about 12.65 m/s with a peak gust to 30.2 m/s, while electrical output stayed high and stable (power mean \u22480.95, std \u22480.022) with a modest positive residual (~0.125). Rotational and control signals show atypical behavior: rotor speed recorded no variability while generator speed had small fluctuations, pitch averaged ~3.54 and yaw misalignment ~2.48; temperatures were elevated (mean \u224873.97). Overall operational status flags remained normal throughout the window despite the noted gust and the lack of rotor speed variation."
