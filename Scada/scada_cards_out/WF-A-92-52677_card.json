  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window the machine ran in sustained high winds (mean \u224815 m/s, low variability) with consistently high power output (mean \u22480.97, very low variability); rotor speed was steady, generator speed showed moderate variability, and blade pitch averaged about 9\u00b0. Notable deviations include an extreme gust to 39.2 m/s, a persistent yaw misalignment near 10\u00b0, a small negative power residual (~\u20110.065) indicating slight underperformance relative to expectations, and elevated operating temperatures, while no non\u2011normal status flags were recorded."
