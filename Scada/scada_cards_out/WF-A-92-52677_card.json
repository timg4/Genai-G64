  "summary": "Over the six-hour window winds averaged ~14.8 m/s with low variability but included a high gust to 39.2 m/s. Power output was steady around 0.97 with very small fluctuation and a slight negative residual, while rotor speed was extremely stable and generator speed showed more variability; mean pitch was ~9.1\u00b0 and yaw misalignment ~10.2\u00b0. Mean temperature was elevated (~65\u00b0C) even though status indicators remained normal."
