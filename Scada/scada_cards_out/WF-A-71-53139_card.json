  "summary": "Over the six-hour window conditions were generally moderate (average wind about 5.4 m/s) but included an isolated strong gust up to 21.3 m/s; average power stayed low and relatively steady with modest short-term variability. Rotor speed was stable while generator-side rotational variability was noticeably higher; pitch was slightly below neutral, yaw misalignment remained consistently around 9.8\u00b0, power residuals were slightly negative on average, no abnormal status events were recorded, and temperatures were moderate (\u224846\u00b0C)."
