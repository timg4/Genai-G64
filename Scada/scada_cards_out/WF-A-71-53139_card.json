  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window winds were moderate and steady (mean ~5.4 m/s, std ~1.1) with a brief high-speed spike up to 21.3 m/s. Power output remained low but relatively stable (mean ~0.1545, std ~0.0794) with a consistent negative residual (~-0.084), one side of the drivetrain showed little speed variability while the generator-side speed fluctuated substantially (~76.6), pitch averaged slightly negative (~-1.2), yaw misalignment averaged ~9.8\u00b0, temperature was ~46\u00b0C, and no non\u2011normal statuses were reported."
