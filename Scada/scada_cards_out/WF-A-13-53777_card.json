  "summary": "Across the 6\u2011hour window the turbine stayed in Normal Operation for all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals, with very stable power output near rated (power_mean 0.9755, power_std 0.0002) despite moderate variability in wind (mean 18.19, std 1.14) and at least one high\u2011wind spike (max 33.6). Rotor speed was essentially constant (rotor_rpm_std 0.0) while generator speed showed small variation (std 0.672), alongside a relatively high average pitch setting (15.46) and a persistent yaw misalignment around 9.40\u00b0. Anomalies/pattern flags during this period were high wind, elevated temperatures (temp_mean 70.59), and a consistently negative power residual on average (-0.1401)."
