  "summary": "Over the 6-hour window winds were consistently high (mean ~18.2, std ~1.14) with a maximum of 33.6, and power output remained extremely steady near its mean (~0.9755, std ~0.0002) but with a notable negative residual bias (~-0.14). Rotor speed showed essentially no variability while generator speed had modest fluctuation; pitch averaged ~15.5 and yaw misalignment averaged ~9.4. Temperatures were elevated (mean ~70.6) and no non-normal statuses were recorded."
