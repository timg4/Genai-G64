  "summary": "Mean wind was about 18 m/s with a peak near 34 m/s, while active power stayed essentially constant at ~0.976 (std 0.0002), indicating very stable output despite high winds. Primary rotational speed showed no variability while the secondary rotation had modest fluctuation (std ~0.61); control angle averaged ~14.8\u00b0 and alignment offset averaged ~8.1\u00b0, with mean temperature \u224867.4\u00b0C. The mean power residual was about -0.11 (measured below expected), and no non-normal status events were recorded."
