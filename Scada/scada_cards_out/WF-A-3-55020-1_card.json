  "summary": "Over the six-hour window the machine ran in sustained, relatively high winds (mean \u224815 m/s, low variability) with occasional strong gusts up to 28 m/s; electrical power stayed consistently near full output with very low variation. Control parameters were mostly stable (very low rotor speed and pitch variability) though the electrical-side speed showed more fluctuation, average yaw misalignment was about 9\u00b0, temperatures were elevated (~65\u00b0C), and power was on average slightly below model expectation (small negative residual) while all operational statuses remained normal."
