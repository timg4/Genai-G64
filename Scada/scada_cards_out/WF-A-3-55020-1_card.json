  "summary": "Over this 6\u2011hour window the turbine operated continuously in Normal Operation across all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals, delivering very stable, near\u2011rated power (power_mean 0.9726 with low variability) alongside low rotor and generator speed variability. Wind conditions were generally steady (mean ~15 m/s, low std) with at least one brief higher\u2011wind episode (max 28.1 m/s), while average pitch (~9.53) and yaw misalignment (~8.93) stayed elevated. Operationally, the period is characterized by persistently elevated temperatures (temp_mean ~65.23) and a consistently negative power residual (mean \u22120.0836), indicating power was below expectation on average for the observed conditions."
