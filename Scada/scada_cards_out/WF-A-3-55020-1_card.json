  "summary": "Winds were strong and relatively steady over the 6\u2011hour window (mean ~15.0 m/s, std ~0.82, peak 28.1 m/s), and power output remained stable around 0.9726 with very low variability (std ~0.0059). Rotor speed was essentially constant (std ~0.03) while generator speed showed noticeably higher fluctuation (std ~1.05); pitch held near 9.53\u00b0 and yaw misalignment persisted around 8.93\u00b0, with a small negative power residual (~-0.084). Average equipment temperature was elevated (~65.2\u00b0C) throughout the period, and no non\u2011normal operational statuses were recorded."
