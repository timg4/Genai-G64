  "summary": "Over the six-hour window winds were very light (mean ~1.21 m/s, max 5.2 m/s) and the machine produced essentially zero mean power with very low power variability; ambient temperature was stable (~24.4 \u00b0C) and status flags remained normal. Operationally the rotor speed was flat while the generator speed varied substantially (std 0 vs 13.2 rpm), pitch was held steady at 24\u00b0, and a persistent large angular offset (~76.6\u00b0) between machine heading and wind direction was present; power residuals had a positive mean (~0.168), indicating a consistent offset between measured and expected power."
