  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window winds were very light on average (~1.5 m/s) with low variability but occasional gusting to 8 m/s; mean electrical power remained essentially zero with very small spread and operational status flags stayed normal. Mechanical signals show low rotor-speed variability but unusually high variability in generator speed, blade pitch averaged relatively high (~24\u00b0), there was a persistent large orientation offset (~103\u00b0) between the machine and the inflow, and ambient temperature averaged about 26\u00b0C, with a small positive power residual (~0.08)."
