  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window wind was very light on average (mean ~1.48 m/s, sd ~0.72) with occasional gusts up to 8 m/s, and mean power output stayed effectively at zero (mean ~-0.0025, sd ~0.0011) with a small positive residual (~0.081). Rotor speed was steady (rpm sd ~1.9) but generator speed exhibited unusually high variability (sd ~220.9), pitch was held relatively high (~23.7\u00b0) and there was a large average directional offset (~103.2\u00b0); ambient temperature averaged ~26.1\u00b0C and no non-normal status flags were recorded."
