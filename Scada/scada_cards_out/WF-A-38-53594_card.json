  "summary": "Over this 6\u2011hour window the turbine stayed in Normal Operation for all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals, with relatively steady production (power_mean 0.159, power_std 0.057) under generally moderate winds (wind_speed_mean 5.72, wind_speed_std 0.67). Operationally, rotor and generator speeds were fairly stable (rotor_rpm_std 0.53; generator_rpm_std 59.68) with a consistent average pitch setting (pitch_mean \u22121.45) and a notable average yaw misalignment of 12.6\u00b0. Anomalies are limited to a single extreme wind_speed_max of 25.8 and a sustained negative power residual on average (\u22120.077), while temperature remained steady around 50.0."
