  "summary": "Over the six-hour window winds were steady around 5.7 m/s with low variability but included a brief extreme gust to 25.8 m/s; mean power output was low (~0.16) with modest variability. Rotor speed variability was low while generator speed showed large fluctuations (std \u2248 59.7), blade pitch averaged slightly negative (~\u22121.45\u00b0) and yaw misalignment was consistently high (~12.6\u00b0); power residuals were persistently negative (~\u22120.077). Temperature averaged about 50\u00b0C and the monitored status remained normal throughout."
