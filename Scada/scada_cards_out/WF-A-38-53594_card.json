  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window winds were generally steady and moderate (mean \u2248 5.7 m/s, sd \u2248 0.67) with stable rotor speed (rotor rpm sd \u2248 0.53) and modest pitch activity (mean \u2248 -1.45\u00b0), though there was a short high\u2011wind spike up to 25.8 m/s and unusually high generator rpm variability (std \u2248 59.7). Power was low on average (mean \u2248 0.159) and tended to run below expectations (mean residual \u2248 -0.077), while a persistent yaw misalignment (~12.6\u00b0) and an elevated mean temperature (~50\u00b0C) are notable despite no non\u2011normal status indications."
