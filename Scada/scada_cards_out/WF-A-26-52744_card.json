  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window wind conditions were steady around 15 m/s with low variability but included a brief gust to 34.7 m/s; rotor speed was essentially constant while generator speed showed only minor fluctuations. Power output remained nearly constant (~0.98) yet averaged about 0.085 below expected values, operational status indicators were non\u2011normal for the entire period, control settings held moderate pitch (~10.5\u00b0) with small yaw misalignment (~1.6\u00b0), and temperatures averaged around 65\u00b0C."
