  "summary": "Over this 6\u2011hour window the turbine is predominantly not operating, with 37 consecutive 10\u2011minute intervals in a Downtime state. Wind conditions are generally steady (mean 15.19 m/s, std 1.01) but include an isolated extreme gust (max 34.7 m/s), while power output is nearly flat (mean 0.9755, very low variability) alongside zero rotor speed variability and some generator speed variation. Operationally, the period is characterized by high-wind conditions coinciding with a persistent power deficit (negative power residual mean \u22120.0853) and elevated temperatures (mean 65.08)."
