  "summary": "Across this 6\u2011hour window the turbine is predominantly in **Downtime** (37 ten\u2011minute intervals), with generation effectively flat near rated when present (power_mean **0.974** with very low variability **0.0044**). Wind conditions are generally steady (mean **15.9 m/s**, std **1.16**) but include an extreme peak (**44.3 m/s**, tagged **high_wind**).\n\nOperationally, rotor speed shows no variability (rotor_rpm_std **0.0**) while generator speed varies modestly (std **0.67**), alongside average pitch around **10.53\u00b0** and notable mean yaw misalignment (**9.58\u00b0**). A consistent negative power residual (mean **-0.1226**, tagged **power_deficit**) indicates measured power trending below the reference expectation during the window; average temperature is **68.6**."
