  "summary": "Over the six-hour window wind conditions were strong and steady (mean ~15.9 with low variability) but included a large peak to 44.3, while ambient temperature averaged ~68.6. Power output was very stable (mean ~0.974, std ~0.0044) yet consistently below expectations (mean residual \u2248 -0.123); rotor speed showed no variability, generator speed only minor fluctuation, pitch averaged ~10.5\u00b0, yaw misalignment ~9.6\u00b0, and status indicators remained outside normal range for the entire period."
