  "summary": "Over the six-hour window winds were consistently high (~16 m/s, SD ~1.2) with a brief extreme gust to 44.3 m/s; despite that, power stayed very tightly clustered around 0.974 (SD ~0.0044) and exhibited a persistent negative residual of about -0.12, indicating a steady shortfall relative to expected output. Rotational speed was effectively constant while generator speed showed only minor variability, blade pitch averaged ~10.5\u00b0, yaw was persistently misaligned by ~9.6\u00b0, system status was continuously flagged as non-normal, and temperature held near 68.6."
