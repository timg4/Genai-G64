  "summary": "Over the 6-hour window the machine ran in sustained elevated winds (mean ~14.6 m/s, gusting to 39.1 m/s) with power output relatively steady (mean ~0.955 per-unit, low variability) but averaging about 9.3% below expected. Control settings were stable\u2014small rotor speed and pitch variability\u2014while generator speed showed notably larger fluctuations and yaw misalignment averaged roughly 12 degrees. Temperatures were elevated (~71.3) despite no non-normal operational flags being recorded."
