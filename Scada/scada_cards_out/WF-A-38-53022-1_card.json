  "summary": "Over the six-hour window winds were consistently high, averaging ~14.6 m/s with gusts up to 39.1 m/s; rotational speeds were steady (very low variability), blade pitch averaged ~9\u00b0, and yaw misalignment averaged ~12\u00b0. Mean power output was about 0.955 p.u. (roughly 9% below expected based on conditions) with low variability, temperatures were elevated (~71), and no non-normal status events were recorded."
