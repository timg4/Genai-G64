  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window wind was generally steady (mean ~13.7, low variability) with a brief extreme gust to 43.7; power was high on average (~0.93) but exhibited noticeable variability (std ~0.12) while mean residuals remained small. One rotational speed showed large spread compared with the other, blade pitch and yaw offset averaged around 8\u00b0, average temperature was ~72.5, and all records were flagged as non\u2011normal throughout the period."
