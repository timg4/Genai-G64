  "summary": "Across the 6\u2011hour window the turbine spent most of the time in a downtime state (37 ten\u2011minute intervals), with only limited periods contributing to power production; when producing, output was fairly steady around 0.93 (std 0.12) despite moderate wind variability (mean 13.7 m/s, std 1.49). Operational signals show notable variability in rotating speeds (rotor rpm std 1.62; generator rpm std 179) alongside moderate average pitch (~8.2) and yaw misalignment (~8.6). Anomalies include an extreme wind speed maximum of 43.7 m/s and flagged power variability, while the average power residual stayed near zero (~0.01) and temperature averaged ~72.5."
