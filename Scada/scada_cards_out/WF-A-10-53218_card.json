  "summary": "Over this 6\u2011hour window, the turbine spent all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals in **Downtime**, with **no power production** despite generally strong and variable winds (mean 14.24 m/s, std 1.46, peak 27.4) and a **high_wind** tag. Operational signals showed relatively steady pitch (mean 7.98) and low yaw misalignment on average (2.2), while temperatures were elevated (mean 67.62) consistent with the **elevated_temps** tag.\n\nThe key anomaly is the persistent downtime concurrent with high wind conditions, alongside a non\u2011zero power residual (mean 0.0995) and low variability in rotor speed (std 0.0229) relative to generator speed (std 0.7666)."
