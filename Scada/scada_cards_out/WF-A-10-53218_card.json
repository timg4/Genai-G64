  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window winds were strong and steady (mean ~14.24, std ~1.46) with intermittent gusts to 27.4, and temperatures remained elevated (mean ~67.6). Power stayed consistently high (mean ~0.96) with low variability and a persistent positive residual (~0.10); rotor speed was tightly held (very low std) while generator speed showed noticeably more fluctuation. Pitch averaged about 8\u00b0 and average yaw misalignment was ~2.2\u00b0, and the operational status was non\u2011normal for the entire period."
