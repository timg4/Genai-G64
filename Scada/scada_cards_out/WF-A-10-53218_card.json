  "summary": "Over the six-hour window wind averaged 14.24 m/s (\u03c3 1.46) with a peak to 27.4 m/s; power stayed high and tightly clustered around 0.9607 (\u03c3 0.046) with a small positive residual bias (~0.10). Rotor speed was very stable (rpm \u03c3 0.0229) while generator speed showed notably higher variability (\u03c3 0.7666); pitch averaged ~8\u00b0 and yaw misalignment ~2.2\u00b0, and mean component temperature was elevated at ~67.6\u00b0C, indicating steady production under strong winds with occasional high gusts and modest generator\u2011side variability."
