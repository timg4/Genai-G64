  "summary": "Over the six-hour window winds were generally low (mean ~2.8 m/s) with modest variability and a single spike to 12.4 m/s; electrical output remained essentially zero with very little fluctuation and a small positive residual. The primary rotor speed was steady while the generator-side speed varied, blade pitch stayed near a high setpoint, a large, sustained alignment offset was present, the system reported non-normal status for the entire period, and average temperature was about 34\u00b0C."
