  "summary": "Across the 6\u2011hour window, the turbine is consistently in **Downtime** for all **35** ten\u2011minute intervals, with **near\u2011zero power** (mean \u22120.0018, std 0.001) despite generally low wind (mean 2.77 m/s, std 0.88) and one brief higher wind event (max 12.4 m/s). Rotor speed shows **no variability** (rotor_rpm_std 0.0) while generator speed has limited variation (std 3.91), alongside a **high average pitch** (85.29) and **elevated yaw misalignment** (mean 65.51; tagged), and the **power residual** is positive on average (0.0243). Temperatures are steady/moderate (mean 34.3)."
