  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window ambient wind was generally low (mean \u22482.8 m/s) with a brief spike to ~12.4 m/s; electrical output was essentially zero on average with very low scatter and a small positive residual bias. Control surfaces stayed near a high angle (~85\u00b0) while the unit showed a persistent orientation offset averaging ~65\u00b0, operational-state indicators were non-standard for the entire period, rotor speed was effectively constant while the generator shaft showed modest fluctuation, and temperature averaged about 34\u00b0C."
