  "summary": "Over the six-hour window the site saw steady winds near 5.9 m/s with a single gust up to 13.9 m/s; power output stayed low and fairly stable (around 0.18 on average) with a small negative residual suggesting generation was slightly below expected. Rotor speed was stable while generator speed showed much higher variability, yaw was persistently offset by about 8\u00b0, temperatures were elevated but steady (~47.5\u00b0C), and no non-normal operational statuses were recorded."
