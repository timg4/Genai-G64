  "summary": "Over the 6-hour window wind was steady at low-to-moderate speed (mean \u2248 5.9 m/s, std \u2248 0.55) with a single peak to 13.9 m/s; power stayed low and relatively stable (mean \u2248 0.18, std \u2248 0.054) with a small negative residual (~-0.06). Rotor speed variability was minimal while generator speed variability was markedly higher (std \u2248 56 vs \u2248 0.5), pitch averaged about \u22121.65\u00b0, yaw misalignment averaged ~8.16\u00b0, temperature was \u224847.5\u00b0C, and no status changes were recorded."
