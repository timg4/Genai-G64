  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window winds averaged ~14.6 m/s (\u03c3 1.74) with a brief peak to 39.1 m/s; power output stayed fairly steady at ~0.955 (\u03c3 0.028) while rotor speed was nearly constant and generator speed showed modest variability. Notable operational patterns include a consistent negative power residual (mean \u22120.093) indicating underperformance versus expectation, an average blade pitch around 8.9\u00b0, a persistent ~11.9\u00b0 offset between wind and turbine orientation, and elevated temperatures (~71.3\u00b0F), with no abnormal status entries recorded."
