  "summary": "Over the 6-hour window winds were mostly steady (mean ~14.6, std ~1.74) but included a short, strong gust up to 39.1. Power was consistently near 0.955 with low variability yet showed a persistent negative residual (~-0.093), while rotor speed stayed very stable and generator speed was comparatively more variable; pitch averaged ~8.9 and mean yaw misalignment was ~11.9 degrees. Recorded temperatures were elevated (mean ~71.3) and no non-normal status flags were logged."
