  "summary": "Over this 6\u2011hour window the turbine spent all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals in Normal Operation, producing near\u2011rated power on average (power_mean 0.955, low variability power_std 0.028) while wind was generally strong and moderately variable (wind_speed_mean 14.63, std 1.74) with a brief extreme peak (wind_speed_max 39.1). Notable patterns include a consistent power shortfall versus expectation (power_residual_mean \u22120.093) alongside sustained yaw misalignment (mean 11.89\u00b0) and elevated temperatures (temp_mean 71.30), with relatively stable rotor speed (rotor_rpm_std 0.0495) but more variable generator speed (generator_rpm_std 4.56). Pitch averaged 8.91\u00b0, consistent with controlled operation under higher winds."
