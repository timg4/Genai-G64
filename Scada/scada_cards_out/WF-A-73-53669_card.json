  "summary": "Over the six-hour window wind was relatively steady on average (mean ~13.45, std ~1.30) but included an extreme short-lived gust (max 44). Power production was low on average (~0.30) yet highly variable (std ~0.45) with a negative mean residual (~-0.63); rotor speed variability was modest (~6.9) while generator speed variability was very large (~769), and blade pitch averaged high (~63.8) with a consistent yaw misalignment (~8.3). The system remained in non-normal operational states throughout the period and temperatures averaged about 61.1."
