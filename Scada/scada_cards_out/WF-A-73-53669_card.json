  "summary": "Over this 6\u2011hour window winds averaged about 13.5 m/s with low short\u2011term variability (std ~1.3) but included a large spike to 44 m/s; despite those conditions, power was low on average and highly variable (mean ~0.30, std ~0.45) with a sizable negative residual (~-0.63) indicating consistent underproduction versus expected output. Rotational speeds were notably variable (rotor rpm std ~6.9; generator rpm std ~769), pitch angle averaged high (~63.8\u00b0), yaw misalignment averaged ~8.3\u00b0, all status indicators were non\u2011normal throughout the window, and temperatures averaged ~61.1\u00b0C."
