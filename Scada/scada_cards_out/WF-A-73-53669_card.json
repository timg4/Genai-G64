  "summary": "Over this 6\u2011hour window the turbine spent all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals in downtime, with average power very low (0.30) and highly variable (std 0.45), consistent with the flagged power_deficit and power_variability tags. Wind conditions were generally moderate and steady on average (mean 13.45 m/s, std 1.30) but included at least one extreme spike (max 44), alongside notable drivetrain speed scatter (generator_rpm_std 769, rotor_rpm_std 6.9). Pitch remained high on average (63.8) with a moderate mean yaw misalignment (8.26), and the power residual was strongly negative on average (-0.63) while temperatures averaged 61.1."
