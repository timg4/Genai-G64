  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window, wind averaged about 13.2 with low variability (~1.5) but included intermittent gusts up to 31, producing fairly steady power around 0.935 with small residuals. Rotor speed was very stable while generator speed showed notably higher variability (~2.8), average blade pitch was ~4.6 and yaw misalignment around 9.3, operating temperature averaged ~67.8, and operational indicators flagged persistent abnormal conditions throughout the period."
