  "summary": "Over the 6-hour window mean wind was about 13.2 m/s with modest variability (std 1.54) and a peak gust to 31 m/s; mean power stayed roughly constant at ~0.935 with low variability (std 0.041) and a small positive power residual (~0.063). Rotor speed was very stable while generator speed showed moderate scatter (std ~2.82), pitch averaged ~4.55\u00b0, yaw misalignment averaged ~9.32\u00b0, and temperatures were elevated (mean ~67.8), so overall operation was steady but featured a pronounced high-wind spike and sustained higher temperatures."
