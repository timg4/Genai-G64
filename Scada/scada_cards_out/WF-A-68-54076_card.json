  "summary": "Over this 6\u2011hour window the turbine was predominantly unavailable, with 37 consecutive 10\u2011minute intervals in a downtime state, so operational output was limited and relatively steady when present (power_mean \u22480.935 with low variability). Ambient conditions were generally high wind (wind_speed_mean \u224813.2, \u03c3\u22481.5) with at least one extreme gust (wind_speed_max 31) and tags indicating elevated temperatures (temp_mean \u224867.8). Control/operational indicators show moderate average pitch (\u22484.55), notable mean yaw misalignment (\u22489.32), and a positive mean power residual (\u22480.063), suggesting output tended to run above the modeled expectation during the periods with data."
