  "summary": "Over this 6\u2011hour window the turbine was predominantly not generating: 37 consecutive 10\u2011minute intervals were in \u201cDowntime,\u201d despite generally steady winds on average (mean 18.43 m/s, low variability) with an isolated extreme gust to 43.9 m/s. Measured power stayed low and tight (mean 0.962, std 0.050) and the negative mean power residual (-0.115) indicates sustained underperformance versus expectation, consistent with the \u201cpower_deficit\u201d tag. Operating conditions included relatively high average pitch (16.35\u00b0), moderate mean yaw misalignment (7.88\u00b0), and a warm average temperature (64.81), with comparatively higher variability on the generator side (generator rpm std 56.85)."
