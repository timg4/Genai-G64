  "summary": "Over the 6-hour window wind conditions were high and relatively steady (mean 18.4 m/s, sd 1.05) with an extreme gust to 43.9 m/s; rotor speed remained stable (sd ~0.52) while generator speed exhibited much larger variability (sd ~56.85). Power output averaged 0.962 (sd 0.050) but carried a consistent negative residual (mean -0.115), indicating delivered power was systematically below the reference expectation. All status records for the interval were non-normal (ratio = 1.0), with mean pitch \u224816.35, yaw misalignment \u22487.88 and temperature \u224864.8 that warrant operational attention."
