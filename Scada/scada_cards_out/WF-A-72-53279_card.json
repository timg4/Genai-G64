  "summary": "Over the six-hour window wind conditions were steady around 15.7 with low variability but included a brief high spike to 36.8; power output, however, was essentially constant at ~0.9755 with negligible variability while power residuals averaged about -0.11, indicating a consistent shortfall versus expected. Rotor speed showed no variability while generator speed varied slightly; pitch averaged ~10.7 and yaw misalignment ~1.6\u00b0, system status was non-normal for the entire window, and temperatures were elevated (~67\u00b0C)."
