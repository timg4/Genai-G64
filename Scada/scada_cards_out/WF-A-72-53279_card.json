  "summary": "Over the six-hour window, wind speeds averaged about 15.7 with low variability but included a pronounced peak to 36.8, while rotor speed was essentially constant and generator speed varied only slightly. Power output was nearly steady (mean ~0.9755, very small std) yet exhibited a consistent negative residual (mean \u22120.1117), indicating sustained underproduction relative to expectations. Yaw misalignment averaged ~1.58\u00b0, pitch ~10.65, reported operational status was non-normal for the entire window, and temperatures averaged about 67."
