  "summary": "Over this 6\u2011hour window the turbine spent all 37 ten\u2011minute intervals in **Downtime**, with **near\u2011zero and extremely steady power output** (power_mean \u2248 0.9755, power_std \u2248 0.0002) and **no rotor speed variation** (rotor_rpm_std = 0.0) while generator speed showed only minor variability. Environmental and operating indicators show **high and variable wind** (wind_speed_mean \u2248 15.74 with a max of 36.8), **persistent negative power residuals** (mean \u2248 \u22120.1117), and **elevated temperatures** (temp_mean \u2248 67.0), with moderate pitch (~10.65) and low average yaw misalignment (~1.58)."
