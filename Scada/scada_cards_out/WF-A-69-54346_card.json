  "summary": "Over the six-hour window the wind was generally steady (mean ~5.04 m/s, std ~0.50) but punctuated by a brief extreme gust to 28.1 m/s; mean electrical output was low (~0.092, std ~0.031) with a persistent negative residual (~-0.094) indicating output consistently below expected. Mechanical signals show very stable rotor speed (rotor rpm std ~0.18) while generator rpm varied substantially (~22.2), pitch held near -1.11\u00b0 and yaw misalignment averaged ~2.07\u00b0, temperature averaged ~47\u00b0C, and no non-normal status flags were recorded."
