  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window wind conditions were generally steady (mean ~5.04 m/s, std ~0.50) with a single high gust to 28.1 m/s; ambient/operational temperature averaged ~47\u00b0C and status indicators were nominal. Power output was unusually low (mean ~0.092) with a negative mean residual (~-0.094) versus expectations, rotor speed remained very stable while generator speed showed substantial variability, and mean pitch was slightly negative with an average yaw misalignment near 2\u00b0."
