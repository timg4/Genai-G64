  "summary": "Over the 6\u2011hour window wind conditions were generally light (mean ~2.7 m/s) with a brief peak to 10 m/s, and mean electrical output remained essentially zero. Mechanical/controls signals show near\u2011constant high pitch (~88\u00b0) and substantial yaw offset (~29\u00b0), with low rotor speed variability but unusually large generator speed variability; the system also reported an atypical operational state for the entire period and ambient temperature was ~30\u00b0C."
