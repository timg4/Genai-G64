          "text": "LIGHTNING PROTECTION SYSTEM (LPS) May 2, 2023 Lightning, Lightning Protection System, LPS, renewable energy consultant, wind energy, wind turbine, wind turbine blade repair The Lightning Protection System (LPS) is a passive lightning protection, ensuring that lightning strikes hitting the blade are transferred to the grounding. The systems are tested in accordance to the IEC 61400-24 standard. Dependent on the test tier the system is designed to handle 100-200kA, without significant system wear. Receptors The receptor is a component made from metal like copper or equivalent current transferring metal alloy. It is designed to attract lightning and transfer the load to the receptor block. The receptor has a conic screw below the base that ensures contact to the receptor block. The receptor is a replaceable component that is mounted post blade production. On older blades the tip receptor can be a massive copper piece taking up the outer 20cm of the blade tip. Risks of failure are worn receptor base or missing connection to the receptor block. The wear mechanisms include arching of the receptor base from lightning attachments and corrosion from water ingress between the receptor and receptor block. Visual inspection can be used to determine the condition of a receptor. Scorching and deformation are the most common signs of wear from lightning on the receptor base. Lightnings will also remove some material of the receptor base over time. If material removal proceeds below the blade surface, the receptor will have a reduced attractiveness to lightning. Missing sealant allows water ingress between the receptor and the receptor block, which can cause corrosion and damage to receptor block over time. Lightning Protection system receptor block To connect the receptor with the down conductor cable, an aluminum block is cast into the blade with the down-conductor during blade production. Replacement requires a complex laminate repair as the blade laminate must be removed before the block can be accessed. During post processing of the blade the receptor hole is drilled along with the thread for the conic screw. Risk of failure is detachment or missing connection to down conductor cable or receptor. Missing connection to the receptor can be deducted from damaged or missing sealant around the receptor and corrosion of the two components. Another cause for imperfect connection between the block and the receptor is if the receptor has been screwed at an angle to the block, causing only partial contact, thus reduced capacity to safely transfer lightning. A missing connection between the receptor block and down conductor cable cannot be detected by a visual inspection. Instead, it can be checked with a resistance measurement. This type of check is recommended only as investigation to locate defect in a malfunctioning system and",

          "text": "could cause undesired lightning jumps to other parts of the turbine Large failures due to a wrong lightning attachment to the blade can be divided in two main categories. The first category is due to a “force majeure” event, which is described as a lightning with unusually high current that exceeds the design limitations of the LPS. The second category is due to a defect in the LPS, which leads to a reduced ability to transfer the lightning. Or a missing connection along the system, thus reducing the likelihood of a lightning traveling through it safely all the way to the ground. The risk of the latter can be reduced by having a maintenance schedule in place for blades. This would also prevent some fatigue damages from going unnoticed. While the “force majeure” damages are hard to influence, defects due to malfunctioning LPS can be minimised with a more focused effort from the industry. In the present, Germany is the only country which has meaningful legislation about the inspection of an LPS – namely it should be inspected every 4 years as a minimum. For comparison, turbine owners in Denmark are only obliged to inspect the LPS of their turbines, when they have reached 20 years in operation. Installing lightning trackers on sites can help collecting more parameters for lightning that are hitting the turbines. The wind industry will benefit from having easy access to accurate lightning data from local site when assessing damage from lightning strikes. Want to learn more?

          "text": "connection is established lightning would seek other paths to the ground, risking damage to the laminate or drivetrain, which is not designed to carry electrical current. Lightning transfer system The design of the transfer system varies between the different OEMs. It can be spring coupling, brushing, or spark gap. The brush and coupling designs are made to have as minimum partial contact from blade to grounding system at all times during operation. These systems are designed to receive limited wear from lightning transfer. The spark gap will transfer the load through an arch between the slipring and the lightning rod. Thus, significant wear could be expected, leading to an occasional need of replacement. The defect mode that can be observed in the lightning transfer system is insufficient contact in the case of the brush or coupling, or too large distance in the case of the spark gap. In both ways the result would be a less effective, or completely dysfunctional LPS. Visual inspection can detect such defects, moreover for brush and coupling designs a resistance measurement can be performed, if there are doubts for the functionality of the system. Lightning Protection System measurement The currently used method of determining whether an LPS is functional is by conducting a resistance measurement. It is performed by connecting multi-meter probes to the two ends of an LPS, essentially creating a closed circuit. To check the functionality of the system within a blade, you must connect one probe to the tip receptor and one probe to the root connection. To check the functionality on turbine level, you must connect one probe to the tip receptor and one probe to the earthing system at the tower base. Performing the measurements between different components of the LPS can help localising the damaged part. For example, if no connection is established during a resistance measurement on blade level from the tip receptor on the SS to the root connection, and a 25mΩ are measured from tip receptor on PS to the root connection, it can be deducted that the damaged part of the LPS is between the tip receptor on the SS and the tip receptor block. It is worth to note that for blades with spark gaps the turbine level functionality cannot be checked in the mentioned method, as there is no physical connection between the part of LPS in the blade and the one in the tower. Reporting The resistance measurement will determine if a connection between the receptor and root connection is present. A common measurement for a 40-45m blade is in the region of 25mΩ, and a full measurement of the grounding system should not exceed 1Ω. NB! For the LPS in the",

          "text": "mentioned method, as there is no physical connection between the part of LPS in the blade and the one in the tower. Reporting The resistance measurement will determine if a connection between the receptor and root connection is present. A common measurement for a 40-45m blade is in the region of 25mΩ, and a full measurement of the grounding system should not exceed 1Ω. NB! For the LPS in the blade OEMs accept between 1-10Ω as part of their factory QC. NB! For the full grounding system OEMs accept up to 10-50Ω as part of their commissioning check. Limitations An LPS inspection will determine if there is a connection between the receptor and the root connection. However, it is not able to determine the quality of the connection, or point to the error location, as even very limited and weak connection points due to partial separation of the LPS or cable fractures will not show from a resistance measurement. As the resistance is a measure of the system’s opposition to the current and not ability to transfer current. A flaw in the system would have a very little contribution to the resistance, but a significantly reduced ability to transfer current. Therefore, even a system with a resistance measurement of 25mΩ, could cause a major damage during a lightning strike due to a partial connection. Recommendation Operators can reduce the risk of lightning damages with conducting regular scheduled inspections of the LPS. A maintenance strategy must be in place to define scope and inspection frequency. Receptor wear and sealant damages can be observed during a standard external inspection; down conductor connection to the root terminal can be visually inspected during a planned turbine maintenance; the integrity of the down conductor can be examined during an internal blade inspection. During an inspection it is important to: Check the surface condition of the receptor, if material wear exceeds below the blade surface, a replacement is required Check the that the connection between the down conductor, root terminal and lightning transfer system is intact. If scorching and/or arching is detected near the root terminal then it is likely that the connection is missing, or it is only partial. Check the surface condition of the transfer system. Too large spark gap or imperfect connection conditions could cause undesired lightning jumps to other parts of the turbine Large failures due to a wrong lightning attachment to the blade can be divided in two main categories.

A missing connection between the receptor block and down conductor cable cannot be detected by a visual inspection. Instead, it can be checked with a resistance measurement. This type of check is recommended only as investigation to locate defect in a malfunctioning system and not as part of general inspection. Down conductor cable The design of the cable varies between the different OEM’s, including copper mesh, solid copper cable, linked aluminum plates and solid cable. The cable is centered on the web of the blade, it can be located on both LE or TE side dependent on the OEM design. The cable is cast into the blade during production. Repair is possible but very complex and due to a clamping device changing shape of the cable the blade has additional risks of wrong lightning attachments post repair. If any carbon is used in the blade to increase the structural strength, it is important that the carbon is included in the LPS to avoid high difference in electric potential between the cable and the carbon laminate. If the carbon is not included, it must be thoroughly checked that it does not provide a risk of lightning jumping internally in the blade. Failure types include missing connection to root terminal, or receptor block and cable separation due to fatigue. Connection to the root terminal can be checked with an internal visual inspection, which can be performed without entering the blade. Detecting separation of the down conductor cable is possible with a dedicated internal inspection. A skilled technician or internal drone can reach 1/3 into the blade, while a sewer crawler can inspect until a few meters from the tip. The most detailed inspection is achieved by a technician or drone inspection. Root connection The root connection is designed to transfer the load from the cable to the bypass system. Blades are equipped with a slipring close to the root. The down conductor cable is connected to the slipring via a connection bolt through the blade laminate or via the backplate. Failure modes at the root terminal include missing connection to the down conductor cable. If no connection is established lightning would seek other paths to the ground, risking damage to the laminate or drivetrain, which is not designed to carry electrical current.

Our members strive for an injury free work environment in the wind turbine industry, setting common international standards for safety training and emergency procedures. This standard describes the requirements for blade repair training that are recommended by the members of GWO. The standard comprises of one module. GWO recognises trained persons as competent within blade repair in the wind industry. GWO accepts the trained person as possessing the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to stop an unsafe work situation where they, as duty holders, are accountable for safety. This standard has been developed in response to the demand for recognisable blade repair training in the industry and has been prepared in co-operation between the members of GWO based on risk assessments, in-depth descriptions of job roles and tasks relevant to blade repair in the wind industry as well as factual incident and accident statistics from G+ and the wind industry. Training is verified through GWO’s WINDA database. General feedback on this document can be sent to info@globalwindsafety.org See globalwindsafety.org on how to raise a complaint about a training provider or report a safety incident occurring during training. 5. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE GWO BLADE REPAIR Upon completion of the GWO Blade Repair Standard (BR), participants will be aware of the risks and hazards encountered when working with blade inspection and repair within the wind industry. Furthermore, they will be able to control and mitigate those risks and hazards. The GWO Blade Repair Standard training will also equip participants with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to appropriately respond in the event of a hazardous situation and to increase their safety through proper use of personal protective equipment, emergency equipment, procedur es and safe craftsmanship. 5.1 Target Group Personnel who will be working in the wind industry, specifically in relation to composite inspection and repair work. Personnel that perform job functions (that have been risk assessed by their employer or their workplace duty holder) that are defined as functions where composite work training, according to this standard, may mitigate some of the identified hazards and risks. 5.2 Aims and Objectives Training in accordance with this standard will enable participants to support and care for themselves and others working in the wind industry by possessing the knowledge and skills of composite inspection and repair work. Upon completion of the GWO Blade Repair Standard training course, participants will be able to work safely with composite materials while conducting inspection and basic blade repair procedures, thereby",

It must be supplemented with additional repair materials specific to the repair being performed. • Glass-fibre mats • Hardback material • Core material • Matrix material • Non-structural adhesive (like Araldite 2021) • Structural adhesive • Filler • Gelcoat • Paint Repair stage 1 Preparation Gather all documentation, tools and materials that are required for the inspection and repair task. Assessment and damage removal 1) Photograph the initial damage, making sure to include a scale in the photographs to indicate the size of the damage. Make a note of any relevant observations that might indicate the root cause of the damage 2) Perform a tap test around the damage to identify the extent of underlying delamination. Mark this extent on the blade surface. Note If the laminate has been in prolonged contact with water, it must be dried before repair activities are commenced. 3) Carefully remove all the damaged material, taking care to not damage underlying structural elements like spar caps. 4) Assess the size of the repair needed, taking into consideration the overlaps required for each layer of laminate and the size of the core material (if required). Note During removal of the damaged material, it may be found that the repair size exceeds the ability of the technician performing the repair. In this case, work should stop and the OEM contacted for advice on how to proceed. 5) Carefully grind the existing laminate around the area being repaired, to create overlaps in each layer of laminate being repaired. 6) Clean the repair area with a cleaning agent, ensuring that you remove all dust, debris and oils Repair stage 2 Preparation 1) Measure the extent of the overlaps and the removed core material created above. Use these measurements to carefully cut and shape the repair pieces as required, taking care to ensure the correct fibre orientation for each repair layer. Note A fundamental principle of fibre-reinforced composite repair work is that you should replace what you take out. This applies in the case of blade repair work, but you should consult the OEM specific repair instructions and or blade drawings to identify which materials to use for the repair task. 2) Calculate the amount",

          "text": "LIGHTNING PROTECTION SYSTEM (LPS) May 2, 2023 Lightning, Lightning Protection System, LPS, renewable energy consultant, wind energy, wind turbine, wind turbine blade repair The Lightning Protection System (LPS) is a passive lightning protection, ensuring that lightning strikes hitting the blade are transferred to the grounding. The systems are tested in accordance to the IEC 61400-24 standard. Dependent on the test tier the system is designed to handle 100-200kA, without significant system wear. Receptors The receptor is a component made from metal like copper or equivalent current transferring metal alloy. It is designed to attract lightning and transfer the load to the receptor block. The receptor has a conic screw below the base that ensures contact to the receptor block. The receptor is a replaceable component that is mounted post blade production. On older blades the tip receptor can be a massive copper piece taking up the outer 20cm of the blade tip. Risks of failure are worn receptor base or missing connection to the receptor block. The wear mechanisms include arching of the receptor base from lightning attachments and corrosion from water ingress between the receptor and receptor block. Visual inspection can be used to determine the condition of a receptor. Scorching and deformation are the most common signs of wear from lightning on the receptor base. Lightnings will also remove some material of the receptor base over time. If material removal proceeds below the blade surface, the receptor will have a reduced attractiveness to lightning. Missing sealant allows water ingress between the receptor and the receptor block, which can cause corrosion and damage to receptor block over time. Lightning Protection system receptor block To connect the receptor with the down conductor cable, an aluminum block is cast into the blade with the down-conductor during blade production. Replacement requires a complex laminate repair as the blade laminate must be removed before the block can be accessed. During post processing of the blade the receptor hole is drilled along with the thread for the conic screw. Risk of failure is detachment or missing connection to down conductor cable or receptor. Missing connection to the receptor can be deducted from damaged or missing sealant around the receptor and corrosion of the two components. Another cause for imperfect connection between the block and the receptor is if the receptor has been screwed at an angle to the block, causing only partial contact, thus reduced capacity to safely transfer lightning. A missing connection between the receptor block and down conductor cable cannot be detected by a visual inspection. Instead, it can be checked with a resistance measurement. This type of check is recommended only as investigation to locate defect in a malfunctioning system and",

          "text": "the receptor is if the receptor has been screwed at an angle to the block, causing only partial contact, thus reduced capacity to safely transfer lightning. A missing connection between the receptor block and down conductor cable cannot be detected by a visual inspection. Instead, it can be checked with a resistance measurement. This type of check is recommended only as investigation to locate defect in a malfunctioning system and not as part of general inspection. Down conductor cable The design of the cable varies between the different OEM’s, including copper mesh, solid copper cable, linked aluminum plates and solid cable. The cable is centered on the web of the blade, it can be located on both LE or TE side dependent on the OEM design. The cable is cast into the blade during production. Repair is possible but very complex and due to a clamping device changing shape of the cable the blade has additional risks of wrong lightning attachments post repair. If any carbon is used in the blade to increase the structural strength, it is important that the carbon is included in the LPS to avoid high difference in electric potential between the cable and the carbon laminate. If the carbon is not included, it must be thoroughly checked that it does not provide a risk of lightning jumping internally in the blade. Failure types include missing connection to root terminal, or receptor block and cable separation due to fatigue. Connection to the root terminal can be checked with an internal visual inspection, which can be performed without entering the blade. Detecting separation of the down conductor cable is possible with a dedicated internal inspection. A skilled technician or internal drone can reach 1/3 into the blade, while a sewer crawler can inspect until a few meters from the tip. The most detailed inspection is achieved by a technician or drone inspection. Root connection The root connection is designed to transfer the load from the cable to the bypass system. Blades are equipped with a slipring close to the root. The down conductor cable is connected to the slipring via a connection bolt through the blade laminate or via the backplate. Failure modes at the root terminal include missing connection to the down conductor cable. If no connection is established lightning would seek other paths to the ground, risking damage to the laminate or drivetrain, which is not designed to carry electrical current. Lightning transfer system The design of the transfer system varies between the different OEMs. It can be spring coupling, brushing, or spark gap. The brush and coupling designs are made to have as minimum partial contact from blade to grounding system at all times",

Lightning transfer system The design of the transfer system varies between the different OEMs. It can be spring coupling, brushing, or spark gap. The brush and coupling designs are made to have as minimum partial contact from blade to grounding system at all times during operation. These systems are designed to receive limited wear from lightning transfer. The spark gap will transfer the load through an arch between the slipring and the lightning rod. Thus, significant wear could be expected, leading to an occasional need of replacement. The defect mode that can be observed in the lightning transfer system is insufficient contact in the case of the brush or coupling, or too large distance in the case of the spark gap. In both ways the result would be a less effective, or completely dysfunctional LPS. Visual inspection can detect such defects, moreover for brush and coupling designs a resistance measurement can be performed, if there are doubts for the functionality of the system. Lightning Protection System measurement The currently used method of determining whether an LPS is functional is by conducting a resistance measurement. It is performed by connecting multi-meter probes to the two ends of an LPS, essentially creating a closed circuit. To check the functionality of the system within a blade, you must connect one probe to the tip receptor and one probe to the root connection. To check the functionality on turbine level, you must connect one probe to the tip receptor and one probe to the earthing system at the tower base. Performing the measurements between different components of the LPS can help localising the damaged part. For example, if no connection is established during a resistance measurement on blade level from the tip receptor on the SS to the root connection, and a 25mΩ are measured from tip receptor on PS to the root connection, it can be deducted that the damaged part of the LPS is between the tip receptor on the SS and the tip receptor block. It is worth to note that for blades with spark gaps the turbine level functionality cannot be checked in the mentioned method, as there is no physical connection between the part of LPS in the blade and the one in the tower. Reporting The resistance measurement will determine if a connection between the receptor and root connection is present. A common measurement for a 40-45m blade is in the region of 25mΩ, and a full measurement of the grounding system should not exceed 1Ω. NB! For the LPS in the",

          "text": "could cause undesired lightning jumps to other parts of the turbine Large failures due to a wrong lightning attachment to the blade can be divided in two main categories. The first category is due to a “force majeure” event, which is described as a lightning with unusually high current that exceeds the design limitations of the LPS. The second category is due to a defect in the LPS, which leads to a reduced ability to transfer the lightning. Or a missing connection along the system, thus reducing the likelihood of a lightning traveling through it safely all the way to the ground. The risk of the latter can be reduced by having a maintenance schedule in place for blades. This would also prevent some fatigue damages from going unnoticed. While the “force majeure” damages are hard to influence, defects due to malfunctioning LPS can be minimised with a more focused effort from the industry. In the present, Germany is the only country which has meaningful legislation about the inspection of an LPS – namely it should be inspected every 4 years as a minimum. For comparison, turbine owners in Denmark are only obliged to inspect the LPS of their turbines, when they have reached 20 years in operation. Installing lightning trackers on sites can help collecting more parameters for lightning that are hitting the turbines. The wind industry will benefit from having easy access to accurate lightning data from local site when assessing damage from lightning strikes. Want to learn more?

          "text": "mentioned method, as there is no physical connection between the part of LPS in the blade and the one in the tower. Reporting The resistance measurement will determine if a connection between the receptor and root connection is present. A common measurement for a 40-45m blade is in the region of 25mΩ, and a full measurement of the grounding system should not exceed 1Ω. NB! For the LPS in the blade OEMs accept between 1-10Ω as part of their factory QC. NB! For the full grounding system OEMs accept up to 10-50Ω as part of their commissioning check. Limitations An LPS inspection will determine if there is a connection between the receptor and the root connection. However, it is not able to determine the quality of the connection, or point to the error location, as even very limited and weak connection points due to partial separation of the LPS or cable fractures will not show from a resistance measurement. As the resistance is a measure of the system’s opposition to the current and not ability to transfer current. A flaw in the system would have a very little contribution to the resistance, but a significantly reduced ability to transfer current. Therefore, even a system with a resistance measurement of 25mΩ, could cause a major damage during a lightning strike due to a partial connection. Recommendation Operators can reduce the risk of lightning damages with conducting regular scheduled inspections of the LPS. A maintenance strategy must be in place to define scope and inspection frequency. Receptor wear and sealant damages can be observed during a standard external inspection; down conductor connection to the root terminal can be visually inspected during a planned turbine maintenance; the integrity of the down conductor can be examined during an internal blade inspection. During an inspection it is important to: Check the surface condition of the receptor, if material wear exceeds below the blade surface, a replacement is required Check the that the connection between the down conductor, root terminal and lightning transfer system is intact. If scorching and/or arching is detected near the root terminal then it is likely that the connection is missing, or it is only partial. Check the surface condition of the transfer system. Too large spark gap or imperfect connection conditions could cause undesired lightning jumps to other parts of the turbine Large failures due to a wrong lightning attachment to the blade can be divided in two main categories.

If the circuit breaker in your home or business load center (circuit breaker panel) trips, it should be reset by first switching it to the OFF position and then to the ON position. If the breaker trips again immediately, or if it continues to trip after brief periods of normal operation, switch the breaker OFF and contact your Bergey dealer for assistance. The following recommendations will help ensure the safe operation of the Powersync III inverter: 1. Keep all sources of moisture away from the Powersync III enclosure. 2. Do not work near the Powersync III with gasoline, paint thinner, or any material which produces flammable vapor. Do not store flammable materials near the Powersync III enclosure. 3. Do not open the Powersync III enclosure unless the circuit breaker and Accessible Disconnect Switch (ADC) at the base of the tower have been switched OFF. Note that even with the circuit breaker and ADC switched OFF, a shock hazard will still be present inside the Powersync III enclosure for approximately 15 minutes (as the capacitor voltage drains down). 4. Do not block airflow around the Powersync III enclosure in any way. A six- inch clearance must be maintained around the sides, top, and bottom of the enclosure for adequate air circulation.",

Check the voltage and the current of the DC bus (2) going to the inverter or the dumpload (3), using the inverter screen or a clamp meter. Check that the inverter disconnection from the grid is working properly by turning off the grid (4). If the wind is strong enough, the tension will rise above the overvoltage protection limit and all the current goes to the dumpload (3). Check the daily, monthly and/or annually yield on the inverter screen. Check if the values are correct (compare annual yield to average wind speed) (5). Check error messages on the inverter (5). Check that LEDs or screen are working on the charge controller. Maintenance Manual 33",

          "text": "VIII. Trouble-Shooting Problems The following guide can help to pin-point the cause of operational problems with the Bergey EXCEL 15 wind turbine and the Powersync III inverter For problems or symptoms not found in the following listing please contact the Service Department at Bergey Windpower Co. at Tel. No. 1-405-364-4212, Telefax No. 1-405-364-2078, or E- mail: service@bergey.com Problem Cause(s) Diagnosis Remedy Turbine makes an unusual blade sound, such as whistling or buzzing 1. Damaged blade leading edge 2. Blade structural damage 1. Have leading edge inspected 2. Have blades inspected. Cracks outboard of the hub can lead to blade failure. 1. Consult Bergey Service Department 2. If blade damage is suspected, the turbine should be stopped until it is inspected. Contact your dealer. Rotor is unbalanced, causing the turbine to move slightly back and forth as it spins 1. Uneven ice build-up on blades 2. Blade damage 1. Ice on turbine and tower. Turbine ran smoothly before ice storm. Slow rotor speed. 2. No ice. Turbine ran smoothly before 1. Do nothing – ice will dislodge in a few days. No not approach the tower. 2. If blade damage is suspected, the turbine should be stopped until it is inspected. Contact your dealer. Problem Cause(s) Diagnosis Remedy Turbine makes a banging or rattling sound once per revolution, particularly at low speeds 1. Loose spinner 2. Alternator rear bearing ring fasteners loose or missing 3. Alternator bearings 1. Sound is once per revolution. Inspect spinner. 2. Sound is once per revolution. Inspect rear of alternator 3. Excessive grease leakage. Squeaking sounds at low speed. 1. Have spinner inspected 2. Have alternator inspected 3. Have alternator inspected Turbine makes a “fog horn” sound at certain, typically low, wind speeds Electro-mechanical interaction between alternator and inverter that causes transient vibrations in the turbine Sound comes and goes, but occurs at the same wind speed(s) This is normal, but contact your dealer or the Bergey Service Department if the noise is excessive Turbine makes a continuous growling or rumbling sound, which reduces at higher wind speeds 1. Wiring fault 2. Inverter fault 3. Alternator bearings Switch fused disconnect on tower to OFF. If growling disappears an electrical problem is indicated. If growling continues a mechanical problem is indicated 1. Check fuses. Check wiring for continuity, phase-to-phase fault, or short to ground. 2. After completing the wiring check, disconnect the inverter and reconnect wiring to the turbine. If the noise disappears an inverter problem is indicated. 3. Check for excessive grease loss 1. Repair or replace as needed 2. Contact your dealer 3. Have the alternator inspected Problem Cause(s) Diagnosis Remedy Rotor turns slowly and does not speed up in higher winds 1. Ice build-up on blades 2. Short circuit in wiring or inverter 3. Short circuit in tower wiring, slip-rings, or alternator 1. Check for ice 2. Open tower disconnect. If turbine spins freely an electrical system problem is indicated 3. The most likely problem is a shorted alternator. 1. Do nothing – ice will dislodge in a few days. No need to furl the turbine. 2. Contact your dealer 3. Contact your dealer Rotor does not turn at all Mechanical failure inside alternator Rotor does not turn even when winds exceed 15 mph (6.7 m/s) Contact your dealer Powersync III display not functioning 1. No power to inverter 2. Display or other inverter component not functioning properly 1. Turn off utility power to inverter, using the dedicated breaker in your breaker panel, for a minimum of 20 seconds. Then turn power back on using the breaker. Wait 300 seconds (5 minutes). If inverter does not resume operation, with full display functionality, contact your dealer",

          "text": "utility repair crews. During a power outage the Excel 15 turbine will come to a stop. When utility power is restored, the Powersync III will automatically return the wind system to full working status following a five minute delay and then a two minute countdown. These time delays are dictated in the UL standards required by the utilities. The rotor of the EXCEL 15 should begin to rotate when the wind speed reaches approximately 9 mph (4 m/s). Once started, the rotor may continue to turn in winds below 5 mph (2.2 m/s), but the system will not be producing power below this wind speed. NOTE All operational wind speeds given assume steady winds, sea-level conditions and moderate temperatures. Hot weather, high altitude, turbulence and gusting winds will reduce system performance. NOTE The Excel 15 may exhibit poor start-up performance in light steady winds. The design of the blades is optimized for efficiency and storm protection, which necessitated some sacrifice in start-up characteristics. The rotor speed will increase with increasing wind speed and the system will produce a higher output. This output increases rapidly because the energy available in the wind varies as the third power (cube) of the wind speed. For example, if the wind speed increased form 5 mph to 10 mph, a factor of two, the energy in the wind would increase from one unit to eight units, a factor of eight (2 to the 3rd power). One result of this relationship is that there is very little energy available in light winds. For the average site, winds in the range of 12-20 mph (5.5 – 9 m/s) will provide most of the system’s energy production on an annual basis. The Excel 15 will operate at variable speed up to about 20 mph (9 m/s) and about 150 RPM. The speed of the rotor is controlled to limit at about 150 RPM.",

It details the required elements in a work instruction and some text as a suggestion of what should be included in each section. The template is incomplete in some areas and is therefore not intended to be used in its current form SAFETY Work involving the repair of glass fibre-reinforced composite material carries risks to you and those around you. To limit these risks, read and obey the warnings below! WARNING Obey the manufacturer’s instructions when you use cleaning agents, resins, sealants, fillers, and paints. These materials are hazardous to your health and, if used incorrectly, represent a fire hazard. Wear the correct personal protective equipment as specified in the safety data sheet for the materials that you are working with. The materials used in fibre-reinforced composite repair can cause life-changing injuries or death. Wear the correct personal protective equipment: eye protection, correct filter dust mask, hearing protection, disposable coverall, and the correct gloves for the task when you cut, abrade, or drill fibre-reinforced composite materials. The dust from these materials can cause lung injuries and skin irritation. These activities create high levels of noise, which can damage your hearing. Flying debris from these activities can damage your eyes. Environmental conditions The materials used in the repair of fibre-reinforced composite materials are sensitive to environmental conditions like ambient temperature and humidity. When these materials are used outside of their intended temperature and/or humidity range, they may not cure as intended by the manufactur er, leading to health risks from uncured material and a loss of material performance resulting in a failure of the repair. To limit these risks, read and obey the warning below! WARNING Obey the environmental conditions described in the Technical Data Sheet for all materials used. The ambient temperature and humidity must be recorded using a suitable data logger for the entire duration of the repair process. Documentation of the repair During the repair process, it is of utmost importance to document each stage of the repair with photographs, and to include these in a repair report. The repair report must contain, as a minimum: • Batch numbers and expiry dates of all materials used • A record of ambient temperature and humidity throughout the repair process • Curing temperature achieved • Vacuum levels achieved • References to documentation used during the repair • Photographs (including the size and location, site name, turbine ID number, blade serial number and technician) of: - The initial damage - The repair after damaged material has been removed -",

          "text": "4. SCOPE Global Wind Organisation is a non-profit body founded by the wind turbine manufacturers and owners. Our members strive for an injury free work environment in the wind turbine industry, setting common international standards for safety training and emergency procedures. This standard describes the requirements for blade repair training that are recommended by the members of GWO. The standard comprises of one module. GWO recognises trained persons as competent within blade repair in the wind industry. GWO accepts the trained person as possessing the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to stop an unsafe work situation where they, as duty holders, are accountable for safety. This standard has been developed in response to the demand for recognisable blade repair training in the industry and has been prepared in co-operation between the members of GWO based on risk assessments, in-depth descriptions of job roles and tasks relevant to blade repair in the wind industry as well as factual incident and accident statistics from G+ and the wind industry. Training is verified through GWO’s WINDA database. General feedback on this document can be sent to info@globalwindsafety.org See globalwindsafety.org on how to raise a complaint about a training provider or report a safety incident occurring during training. 5. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE GWO BLADE REPAIR Upon completion of the GWO Blade Repair Standard (BR), participants will be aware of the risks and hazards encountered when working with blade inspection and repair within the wind industry. Furthermore, they will be able to control and mitigate those risks and hazards. The GWO Blade Repair Standard training will also equip participants with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to appropriately respond in the event of a hazardous situation and to increase their safety through proper use of personal protective equipment, emergency equipment, procedur es and safe craftsmanship. 5.1 Target Group Personnel who will be working in the wind industry, specifically in relation to composite inspection and repair work. Personnel that perform job functions (that have been risk assessed by their employer or their workplace duty holder) that are defined as functions where composite work training, according to this standard, may mitigate some of the identified hazards and risks. 5.2 Aims and Objectives Training in accordance with this standard will enable participants to support and care for themselves and others working in the wind industry by possessing the knowledge and skills of composite inspection and repair work. Upon completion of the GWO Blade Repair Standard training course, participants will be able to work safely with composite materials while conducting inspection and basic blade repair procedures, thereby",

INSPECTIONS AND MAINTENANCE The Bergey EXCEL 15 turbine and tower should be inspected once 90 - 180 days after installation to ensure that no hardware was missed and there are no issues with the turbine. Following this post-installation inspection, the complete system should be inspected every four years and after any particularly severe weather. Inspections should be done on days when the wind is below 20 mph (9 m/s). Check List for Inspections 1. On guyed towers inspect each of the anchor points. Ensure that all hardware is secure and the guy wires are properly tensioned. Check to ensure that no strands are broken and the turnbuckle safety cables are in place. WARNING: Loose guy wires or unsecured turnbuckles can lead to tower failure. 2. Disconnect the inverter at the breaker panel, which will bring the turbine to a stop. Climb the tower. Always use proper safety climbing gear and safe climbing practices. DANGER Only qualified personnel with proper safety equipment should climb the tower. Never climb the tower when the rotor is turning. 3. Inspect the blades for:",

Remedy: Use good quality guy wire or correctly sized guy wires.Chandlery correct tightness. Broken bearing (figure 59): Bearing was loose and the rubber sealing was missing: Destruction of the bearing rolls, one rotor touched the stator, damages on both rotors and stator. Remedy: Keep and/or add rubber sealing. Avoid play in the conical bearing or use NE bearing. Broken anchor (figure 60): A 22 m/s wind finished to cut a chain holding the guy wires already eroded by sand and lead to the falldown of the tower and the turbine. The pin at the tower base came off and couldn‘t avoid the tower fall - down. Everything was destroyed except rotors: blades, frame, tail, tower a bit deformed but re-used. Remedy: Change guy wires and chains if wear is observed; pour chain into concrete. Change the tower base, the sta- tor, the tail, the frame and replace the 3-phase cable. Broken tail hinge (figure 61): On a very turbulent site, the tail was always moving up and down leading to cracks on the hinge at the low stop level. Remedy: Reinforce the welding (see figure 43, page 28) if your turbine is installed on a very turbulent site. Burnt stator (figure 62): Wind turbine short circuited for some time. A strong windy day leads to this failure. Remedy: In case of strong wind, let your turbine run instead of braking it. Burnt Tristar batteries (figure 63): Problem with a battery that lead the burning of the Tristar which then dumped the battery pack energy directly into the dumpload. Remedy: Check your battery bank. Make sure that your charge controller capacity (e.g. if your system gives 40A, a 45A charge controller is undersized). Loss of a balancing weight (figure 64): The turbine lost one balancing weight leading to severe blade unbalancing. The owner was away for few days during a windy period. The turbine might have shake for some days before falling off the tower. Remedy: Use a greater number of screws that are long enough for the balancing weight, at least 2 per",

Remedy: Use good quality guy wire or correctly sized guy wires.Chandlery correct tightness. Broken bearing (figure 59): Bearing was loose and the rubber sealing was missing: Destruction of the bearing rolls, one rotor touched the stator, damages on both rotors and stator. Remedy: Keep and/or add rubber sealing. Avoid play in the conical bearing or use NE bearing. Broken anchor (figure 60): A 22 m/s wind finished to cut a chain holding the guy wires already eroded by sand and lead to the falldown of the tower and the turbine. The pin at the tower base came off and couldn‘t avoid the tower fall - down. Everything was destroyed except rotors: blades, frame, tail, tower a bit deformed but re-used. Remedy: Change guy wires and chains if wear is observed; pour chain into concrete. Change the tower base, the sta- tor, the tail, the frame and replace the 3-phase cable. Broken tail hinge (figure 61): On a very turbulent site, the tail was always moving up and down leading to cracks on the hinge at the low stop level. Remedy: Reinforce the welding (see figure 43, page 28) if your turbine is installed on a very turbulent site. Burnt stator (figure 62): Wind turbine short circuited for some time. A strong windy day leads to this failure. Remedy: In case of strong wind, let your turbine run instead of braking it. Burnt Tristar batteries (figure 63): Problem with a battery that lead the burning of the Tristar which then dumped the battery pack energy directly into the dumpload. Remedy: Check your battery bank. Make sure that your charge controller capacity (e.g. if your system gives 40A, a 45A charge controller is undersized). Loss of a balancing weight (figure 64): The turbine lost one balancing weight leading to severe blade unbalancing. The owner was away for few days during a windy period. The turbine might have shake for some days before falling off the tower. Remedy: Use a greater number of screws that are long enough for the balancing weight, at least 2 per balancing weight and good quality screws (stainless). Rusted guy wire (figure 65): After 6 months old in a sandy area of the African coast with brand new (quality) guy wires Remedy: Car oil or plant oil to protect them from corrosion. Rusted rotor (figure 66): During a preventative maintenance we have seen some cracks in the resin and a little space between the resin and the steel disc. As a consequence we could quite easily remove the block of resin from the disc. Under the resin, the disc was rusted. Remedy: Paint the rotor during every maintenance. Paint or galvanise (best solution) the steel disk before putting the mag- nets. Thread rod too long (figure 67): 28m tower; 4.2m turbine. On a very windy day, the tail vane hit the blade: blade and stator broken, frame and tail badly damaged. The thread rod was too long so the balancing weight touched the thread rod, breaking the stator and damaging the frame. A problem that could have been avoided by more precise work. Remedy: We changed the design of the tail vane for the 4.2m turbine. Make sure you are checking all details especially on big turbines. The bigger they are, the more precise you have to be. Tower too tight (figure 68): This curvy tower is the result of an excessive tension in the guy wires. Remedy: Straighten the tower and slacken the guy wires.",

The systems are tested in accordance to the IEC 61400-24 standard. Dependent on the test tier the system is designed to handle 100-200kA, without significant system wear. Receptors The receptor is a component made from metal like copper or equivalent current transferring metal alloy. It is designed to attract lightning and transfer the load to the receptor block. The receptor has a conic screw below the base that ensures contact to the receptor block. The receptor is a replaceable component that is mounted post blade production. On older blades the tip receptor can be a massive copper piece taking up the outer 20cm of the blade tip. Risks of failure are worn receptor base or missing connection to the receptor block. The wear mechanisms include arching of the receptor base from lightning attachments and corrosion from water ingress between the receptor and receptor block. Visual inspection can be used to determine the condition of a receptor. Scorching and deformation are the most common signs of wear from lightning on the receptor base. Lightnings will also remove some material of the receptor base over time. If material removal proceeds below the blade surface, the receptor will have a reduced attractiveness to lightning. Missing sealant allows water ingress between the receptor and the receptor block, which can cause corrosion and damage to receptor block over time. Lightning Protection system receptor block To connect the receptor with the down conductor cable, an aluminum block is cast into the blade with the down-conductor during blade production. Replacement requires a complex laminate repair as the blade laminate must be removed before the block can be accessed. During post processing of the blade the receptor hole is drilled along with the thread for the conic screw. Risk of failure is detachment or missing connection to down conductor cable or receptor. Missing connection to the receptor can be deducted from damaged or missing sealant around the receptor and corrosion of the two components. Another cause for imperfect connection between the block and the receptor is if the receptor has been screwed at an angle to the block, causing only partial contact, thus reduced capacity to safely transfer lightning. A missing connection between the receptor block and down conductor cable cannot be detected by a visual inspection. Instead, it can be checked with a resistance measurement. This type of check is recommended only as investigation to locate defect in a malfunctioning system and",

          "text": "connection is established lightning would seek other paths to the ground, risking damage to the laminate or drivetrain, which is not designed to carry electrical current. Lightning transfer system The design of the transfer system varies between the different OEMs. It can be spring coupling, brushing, or spark gap. The brush and coupling designs are made to have as minimum partial contact from blade to grounding system at all times during operation. These systems are designed to receive limited wear from lightning transfer. The spark gap will transfer the load through an arch between the slipring and the lightning rod. Thus, significant wear could be expected, leading to an occasional need of replacement. The defect mode that can be observed in the lightning transfer system is insufficient contact in the case of the brush or coupling, or too large distance in the case of the spark gap. In both ways the result would be a less effective, or completely dysfunctional LPS. Visual inspection can detect such defects, moreover for brush and coupling designs a resistance measurement can be performed, if there are doubts for the functionality of the system. Lightning Protection System measurement The currently used method of determining whether an LPS is functional is by conducting a resistance measurement. It is performed by connecting multi-meter probes to the two ends of an LPS, essentially creating a closed circuit. To check the functionality of the system within a blade, you must connect one probe to the tip receptor and one probe to the root connection. To check the functionality on turbine level, you must connect one probe to the tip receptor and one probe to the earthing system at the tower base. Performing the measurements between different components of the LPS can help localising the damaged part. For example, if no connection is established during a resistance measurement on blade level from the tip receptor on the SS to the root connection, and a 25mΩ are measured from tip receptor on PS to the root connection, it can be deducted that the damaged part of the LPS is between the tip receptor on the SS and the tip receptor block. It is worth to note that for blades with spark gaps the turbine level functionality cannot be checked in the mentioned method, as there is no physical connection between the part of LPS in the blade and the one in the tower. Reporting The resistance measurement will determine if a connection between the receptor and root connection is present. A common measurement for a 40-45m blade is in the region of 25mΩ, and a full measurement of the grounding system should not exceed 1Ω. NB! For the LPS in the",

          "text": "could cause undesired lightning jumps to other parts of the turbine Large failures due to a wrong lightning attachment to the blade can be divided in two main categories. The first category is due to a “force majeure” event, which is described as a lightning with unusually high current that exceeds the design limitations of the LPS. The second category is due to a defect in the LPS, which leads to a reduced ability to transfer the lightning. Or a missing connection along the system, thus reducing the likelihood of a lightning traveling through it safely all the way to the ground. The risk of the latter can be reduced by having a maintenance schedule in place for blades. This would also prevent some fatigue damages from going unnoticed. While the “force majeure” damages are hard to influence, defects due to malfunctioning LPS can be minimised with a more focused effort from the industry. In the present, Germany is the only country which has meaningful legislation about the inspection of an LPS – namely it should be inspected every 4 years as a minimum. For comparison, turbine owners in Denmark are only obliged to inspect the LPS of their turbines, when they have reached 20 years in operation. Installing lightning trackers on sites can help collecting more parameters for lightning that are hitting the turbines. The wind industry will benefit from having easy access to accurate lightning data from local site when assessing damage from lightning strikes. Want to learn more?

They should be repacked with grease every 3 years or more frequently if necessary. Usually you will require two different sets of roller bearings: 1) The basic kit (figure 34) with the two inner cones and the two roller bearings. 2) The full kit (figure 35) with the basic kit plus the rubber sealing, the nuts, the washer, the safety pin (sometimes optional) and the cap (sometimes optional). Remember: You have to change both roller bearings at the same time. We recommend to get the full kit as it‘s good to have spare parts like a safety pin and it‘s hard to get rid of the rubber sealing without damaging it. Use quality brands like SKF or SNR if possible. Make sure that your working space and your hands are clean of dust when you replace the bearings. You can keep the shaft screwed on the nacelle during the whole operation. Take out the cap by gently knocking it out with a chisel. Depending on your hub: take off the safety pin and the nuts or strike out the nuts with a suitable drift. Be careful with the nuts as you may encounter left hand thread or right hand thread!",

          "text": "6 Maintaining your wind turbine system Fig. 28: Alternator disassembly Fig. 29: Index threaded rod and hole Maintenance Manual 23 The overall procedure operation is to take off the front rotor, then the stator and finally the back rotor but before proces- sing find the index hole (figure 29) or the mark on the stud which indicates alignment for reassembling. If you can‘t find it, make a new one on the stud and the two rotors (before disassembling). Remember that it is very important to have this position marked. Unscrew the nuts from the front rotor. Screw the 3 jacking screws that go into the tapered hole. Screw them simultaniously to keep both rotors parallel all the time. When you have reached 10cm, the magnet field is weak enough for you to pull the rotor away. Store it in clean, dry place, away from metal components. Take away the stator. Remember the stator position (it should be the cable at the bottom). The rotors should be at equal distance all the time. Seminarhaus ökologischer Schaugarten - Witzenhausen Grundlagenrecherche If you detect significant play in the hub, open everything to check and clean or change the roller bearing (see the pro - cedure next page). If the hub shaft is not welded, unscrew the nuts behind the bearing hub rotor of each stud and remove all the studs from the back rotor. Remove the back rotor carefully and put it in a safe place, far from the other rotor. Check the stator and rotor for cracks in the resin structure, for friction and for wires with missing enamel. You will need to change magnets if they are corroded (figure 32). Cut the resin and replace the corroded one with a new magnet. Refill the replaced material with new resin and repaint the whole rotor. Sometimes resin cracks occur at the edge of the rotor (figure 33). Take away the old resin that comes up and replace by a new one. Repaint the whole rotor. If any of the copper wires is without enamel, you should apply some resin or a bit of glue (like epoxy adhesive). You also need to find the cause of the problem and fix it (see Troubleshooting on page 40). Check that you have the same resistance value between the phases by using a multimeter. Check the 3-phase cable that comes out of the resin.",

Rusted guy wire (figure 65): After 6 months old in a sandy area of the African coast with brand new (quality) guy wires Remedy: Car oil or plant oil to protect them from corrosion. Rusted rotor (figure 66): During a preventative maintenance we have seen some cracks in the resin and a little space between the resin and the steel disc. As a consequence we could quite easily remove the block of resin from the disc. Under the resin, the disc was rusted. Remedy: Paint the rotor during every maintenance. Paint or galvanise (best solution) the steel disk before putting the mag- nets. Thread rod too long (figure 67): 28m tower; 4.2m turbine. On a very windy day, the tail vane hit the blade: blade and stator broken, frame and tail badly damaged. The thread rod was too long so the balancing weight touched the thread rod, breaking the stator and damaging the frame. A problem that could have been avoided by more precise work. Remedy: We changed the design of the tail vane for the 4.2m turbine. Make sure you are checking all details especially on big turbines. The bigger they are, the more precise you have to be. Tower too tight (figure 68): This curvy tower is the result of an excessive tension in the guy wires. Remedy: Straighten the tower and slacken the guy wires.",

Be careful. The following recommendation are for off-grid and grid-tied systems To identify an electrical problem, check the voltage between the phases at the bottom of the tower (1 in figure 51), at the brake switch (2 in figure 51), and on the DC bus after the bridge rectifier (3 in figure 51). If the voltage between 2 phases is zero, suspect a short-circuit in the wiring or in the alternator. A pulsating torque hol- ding back the blades indicates a short between two of the 3 wires. If case of a short-circuit, an easy test is to disconnect the tower wire. If the turbine still does not start, then the short is above: in the tower cable or in the alternator. If the turbine does start, then the short is elsewhere (wiring, rectifier or controller). If no current is found, several possibilities: There may be a short-circuit failure of the alternator windings due to burned coil or insulation failures in wet conditions: In this case lower the turbine to check the stator voltage output. Electrical issues can certainly impact energy production. A blown diode in the rectifier or a bad connection in one wire will also have impact on the performance. These faults produce a growling vibration in the machine and uneven volta - ges and currents in the 3 wires.",

          "text": "6 Maintaining your wind turbine system Fig. 28: Alternator disassembly Fig. 29: Index threaded rod and hole Maintenance Manual 23 The overall procedure operation is to take off the front rotor, then the stator and finally the back rotor but before proces- sing find the index hole (figure 29) or the mark on the stud which indicates alignment for reassembling. If you can‘t find it, make a new one on the stud and the two rotors (before disassembling). Remember that it is very important to have this position marked. Unscrew the nuts from the front rotor. Screw the 3 jacking screws that go into the tapered hole. Screw them simultaniously to keep both rotors parallel all the time. When you have reached 10cm, the magnet field is weak enough for you to pull the rotor away. Store it in clean, dry place, away from metal components. Take away the stator. Remember the stator position (it should be the cable at the bottom). The rotors should be at equal distance all the time. Seminarhaus ökologischer Schaugarten - Witzenhausen Grundlagenrecherche If you detect significant play in the hub, open everything to check and clean or change the roller bearing (see the pro - cedure next page). If the hub shaft is not welded, unscrew the nuts behind the bearing hub rotor of each stud and remove all the studs from the back rotor. Remove the back rotor carefully and put it in a safe place, far from the other rotor. Check the stator and rotor for cracks in the resin structure, for friction and for wires with missing enamel. You will need to change magnets if they are corroded (figure 32). Cut the resin and replace the corroded one with a new magnet. Refill the replaced material with new resin and repaint the whole rotor. Sometimes resin cracks occur at the edge of the rotor (figure 33). Take away the old resin that comes up and replace by a new one. Repaint the whole rotor. If any of the copper wires is without enamel, you should apply some resin or a bit of glue (like epoxy adhesive). You also need to find the cause of the problem and fix it (see Troubleshooting on page 40). Check that you have the same resistance value between the phases by using a multimeter. Check the 3-phase cable that comes out of the resin.",

Guide the wires from the thermocouple probe out from the repair, and seal with vacuum sealant tape. Connect the wires to the temperature gauge. 6) Apply the breather fabric on top of the release film. 7) Cut two lengths of vacuum hose – one for the vacuum pump and one for the vacuum gauge. The pieces should be long enough to reach the vacuum pump and gauge. Wrap the repair end of the vacuum hose pieces with breather fabric to ensure that they do not become clogged by vacuum film or resin. 8) Where the vacuum hoses cross the vacuum sealant tape, additional vacuum sealant tape should be applied on top of the hoses to ensure a seal. 9) Connect the vacuum gauge to one of the vacuum hoses, and attach the other hose to the vacuum pump. Use a resin trap between the repair and the vacuum pump. 10) Apply the vacuum film on top of the repair and press it down onto the vacuum sealant tape. 11) Start the vacuum pump and check for air leaks around the repair. Consult the OEM -specific instruction for the vacuum level to be achieved. Curing 1) Consult the TDS for the matrix material, to ascertain the correct curing temperature and time. 2) Place a heating blanket over the repair and switch it on. Adjust the temperature of the heating blanket until the temperature gauge reaches the correct curing temperature. 3) Make a note of the time that the temperature gauge reaches the correct temperature – this is the time at which the curing duration starts. 4) Allow the repair to cure for the time specified in the TDS. WARNING The cured vacuum bagging consumables will have sharp edges 5) After the specified curing time has elapsed, carefully remove the vacuum bagging materials from the repair, leaving the peel ply in place. 6) Verify that the matrix material has reached the specified hardness in the TDS using a Barcol or ShoreD tester. Filling 1) Remove the peel ply from the repair, and sand the surface to the required finish as stated in the TDS for the filler being used. 2) Weigh out and mix the filler (if using a two-component filler) 3) Apply filler to the repair and shape using a plastic scraper so that it matches the surrounding blade profile shape. 4) Allow the filler to cure fully in accordance with the TDS. 5) After the filler has",
