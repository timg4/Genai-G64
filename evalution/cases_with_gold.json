Operational indicators were mostly steady (small rotor RPM variability, modest yaw misalignment ~2.07°, pitch mean −1.11), but the window is characterized by a consistent negative power residual (mean −0.094) aligned with the “power_deficit” tag. One notable anomaly in the summary stats is a very high reported wind speed maximum (28.1) relative to the otherwise tight wind distribution.",
